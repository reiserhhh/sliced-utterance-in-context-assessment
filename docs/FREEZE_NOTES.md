# SUICA Freeze & Independent Release Plan v1

> Historical v0.1 plan. The realized v0.2.0 freeze is specified in
> `V7_LOCKBOX_V020.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES_V020.md`. Opening #1 of the legacy P5
> lockbox was spent after this plan was written; this text is retained for
> provenance rather than rewritten as if it had predicted the result.

Created: 2026-07-05. Status: PLAN (execution gated on the reviewer-readiness
sweep and user go-ahead; precedes OP-3 lockbox opening by design).

## Purpose

Freeze the SUICA method at a reproducible, self-contained state and publish it
as an INDEPENDENT worktree/repository, separate from project persona, so that
reviewers and other researchers can reproduce the validation chain from zero.
Per the user's decision: **v0.1.0 is frozen with the lockbox UNOPENED** — the
strongest possible reproducibility statement, because external-validity
confirmation (P5) can then be performed by anyone, including reviewers,
exactly once, under the committed preregistration.

## Repository shape (proposed name: `suica-method`)

## Data policy (hard constraints)

1. **PANDORA cannot be redistributed.** The original dataset is
   access-controlled by its authors (Gjurkovic et al.); DATA_ACCESS.md ships
   the request procedure + the exact prepared-file schema + SHA-256 manifests
   of our prepared inputs so others can verify byte-identical preparation.
2. **X-market data is excluded entirely** (proprietary collection; only its
   aggregate numbers appear in reports).
3. **Essays**: same policy — schema + acquisition pointer, no raw text.
4. **What DOES ship executable from zero**: the synthetic ground-truth
   harnesses (P0, P0B). A reviewer with no data can verify the estimator
   layer in minutes; with PANDORA access they can rerun the full chain via
   the frozen tier-split script (stable-hash membership is reproducible from
   the raw dataset without our files).
5. No user text, no user IDs, no per-user score tables in the public repo.
   Reports containing aggregate statistics only.

## Freeze mechanics

1. Complete the reviewer-readiness fixes (this session's sweep).
2. `git worktree add` / new repo initialized from an export of the frozen
   file set (NOT a fork of project persona history — the parent repo contains
   unrelated market-agent material and early exploratory noise). Provenance:
   README records the parent commits (154822a, 05be394, cad83d5, + final
   freeze commit) for auditability.
3. Tag `v0.1.0-prereg-sealed`. The preregistration file's commit hash is the
   seal; opening the lockbox later = new tag `v0.2.0` with results appended.
4. CI (optional, later): run tests + P0 + P0B on push.

## Definition of "clean" for v0.1.0

- [ ] Every headline number in docs traces to a script + report in the repo.
- [ ] No hardcoded result strings; reports regenerate from artifacts.
- [ ] Deprecated/duplicated code paths removed or marked (e.g., the historical
      anchor-weighted objective in suica.py carries a deprecation note; naive
      centering marked falsified-do-not-use).
- [ ] Construct registry with operational names (incl. wcl_60 renamed to
      apostrophe-omission register; wcl_02 flagged choice-coupled).
- [ ] Reviewer-readiness sweep items resolved or explicitly listed as
      limitations in README.
- [ ] Lockbox unopened; opening budget statement in PREREGISTRATION.md.
