## 0. The conjecture being formalized

Program owner, 2026-08-09 (two messages, paraphrased with permission of
context):

- **C-1 (structured residual).** Within the same group and the same topic, the
  per-person deviation that classical analysis treats as error is not
  measurement error but identity itself.
- **C-2 (indeterminate magnitude).** That is why the "error's" size is
  indeterminate and appears unmeasurable.
- **C-3 (certificate).** It functions like an identification card.
- **C-4 (similarity and direction, second message).** If identity exists, are
  deviation-close people personality-close? Deviations have direction: a pair
  can be close in distance yet opposite in direction — how does the theory
  close this?

IDT retains C-1, C-3 and C-4's substance, and converts C-2 from an obstacle
into a theorem, with two repairs: a **reproducibility discriminator** (not all
deviation is identity) and **frame-relativity** replacing unmeasurability.

## 1. Frame and objects

A **frame** is F = (P, O, h, U):

- P — the reference sample ("issuer"): the persons whose behavior defines the
  norm;
- O — the occasion universe ("jurisdiction"): the occasion-generating process
  ν, its support and design (shared vs person-specific occasion sets);
- h — the horizon ("expiry"): the time span the universe covers;
- U — the representation ("units"): coordinates in which behavior is a vector;
  in SUICA, the frozen map plus basis.

Objects, all P-type indexed by O in V8's typing discipline:

- behavior x(i,o) ∈ R^m for person i on occasion o, in representation U;
- **norm field** μ̂(o) = mean_{j∈P} x(j,o);
- **deviation field** d(i,o) = x(i,o) − μ̂(o);
- **card** c(i) = mean over person i's sampled occasions of d(i,o), from n
  occasions; r_i = ‖c(i)‖; θ_ij = angle between c(i), c(j);
- **readability** ρ_i = cos(c⁽¹⁾(i), c⁽²⁾(i)) over disjoint occasion halves;
- **identifiability** I = rank-1 re-identification rate: probe cards from one
  half matched by nearest neighbor against a gallery of cards from the other.

## 2. Axioms (modeling commitments, frame-indexed — not metaphysics)

- **A1 (decomposition).** x(i,o) = μ(o) + b(i) + s(i,o) + ε(i,o), with
  E_i[b] = 0; s the state process with person-specific within-horizon mean
  s̄_i(O) (possibly nonzero); ε exchangeable noise. Every component is defined
  relative to (population, ν, U); none is metaphysically absolute.
- **A2 (diversity).** Var_i[b] > 0 at some scale of U.
- **A3 (state structure).** s has autocorrelation time τ_s under the occasion
  process; ε has none.

## 3. Results

Status tags: [PROVED] — elementary proof, stated here; [IMPORTED] — proved
earlier in the program; [PRINCIPLE] — stated, not proved; [OPEN] — registered
branch to be decided by a K-leg.

### T1 — Gauge trichotomy: "the magnitude is indeterminate" is a theorem [PROVED]

Three independent gauge channels move ‖c‖, each with a distinct signature:

1. **Units (U, scalar subgroup).** c ↦ γc, γ>0: all norms scale, all angles
   and shares are fixed (degree-0; the M4-H1 identity [IMPORTED]).
2. **Issuer sampling (P).** μ̂ = μ + δ_P with δ_P = O_p(σ_pop/√|P|): every
   card translates by −δ_P — a **common translation**; the centered
   configuration is exactly invariant (T2).
3. **Jurisdiction (O).** ν → ν′ moves c(i) by s̄_i(ν′) − s̄_i(ν) — a
   **person-specific** shift; the centered configuration genuinely changes.

Beyond the scalar subgroup, U-freedom (diagonal/general basis change) also
moves angles; that freedom is real and materially large in this machinery —
the M4-H line moved the frame displacement by 45.79% through basis
normalization alone [IMPORTED].

**Consequence.** A frame-free "size of identity" does not exist; requesting it
is a type error. C-2's felt indeterminacy is the superposition of three gauges
— and each is detectable by its signature: common translation (issuer error)
vs person-specific shift (jurisdiction change) vs coordinate effects (units).

### T2 — The invariant layer [PROVED]

The centered-card configuration — the Gram matrix of {c_i − c̄} up to overall
scale; equivalently every angle and every norm **ratio** between centered
cards — is exactly invariant under scalar-U and issuer translation. Shares and
cosines are degree-0 in any per-world scalar [IMPORTED: M4-H1, confirmed at
2.22e-16]. Identity claims should be typed on this layer.

### T3 — Issuer cancellation [PROVED in card space]

On shared occasions with a common norm:

- (a) within-occasion contrasts x(i,o) − x(j,o) are exactly norm-free;
- (b) card differences c_i − c_j are exactly issuer-free;
- (c) nearest-neighbor re-identification with a common probe/gallery norm is
  exactly invariant to μ̂ — the norm cancels term-by-term in every distance.

Corollaries:

- (d) **Relative identity needs no issuer; absolute identity does.** The
  person-configuration is issuer-free; the individual card is not.
- (e) **Free-response designs break the cancellation twice**: person-specific
  occasion sets O_i import issuer-sampling error (mean_{O_i} μ̂ − mean_{O_j} μ̂
  no longer cancels) AND jurisdiction misalignment (s̄_i(O_i) vs s̄_j(O_j)
  confound the comparison).
- (f) For the **deployed relational gauge** the cancellation is an
  idealization to be TESTED, not assumed: the frozen map is nonlinear, so a
  pre-map common shift need not cancel post-map. [OPEN → K1 lean L5.]

Retrodiction: M4-F2's composition law — free −0.0027727743463521505 vs shared
+0.023390488960374076, paired +0.026163263306726227, CI [0.019536, 0.032791],
t=9.3351, 8 worlds (artifact precision, re-verified 2026-08-09) — is (e)
appearing as measurement. K1 decomposes its ownership between the issuer-error
and jurisdiction-misalignment channels.

### T4 — Card ≠ biography [PROVED as algebra; empirical form OPEN → K2]

The card estimates b_i + s̄_i(O) + O_p(n^{−1/2}); the trait is b_i; the gap is
s̄_i(O).

- (a) **State helps the card and poisons the biography.** Person-specific s̄_i
  adds between-person dispersion — identifiability RISES — while shifting
  cards off b, capping trait recovery at the attenuation factor
  σ_b/√(σ_b² + Var_i[s̄_i]). A forged watermark: it makes the card easier to
  read and wrong about its holder.
- (b) Var_i[s̄_i(O)] shrinks only as the occasion universe spans many state
  correlation times (h/τ_s grows) — not with more occasions inside a fixed
  span, not with more authors, not with more text per author.

Retrodictions: M4-F5's dissociation (internal agreement 0.0061→0.3861 while
long-window truth recovery plateaus 0.0225→0.1501; same-occasion recovery
0.1497→0.6371 — synthesis precision); F10 (the foundation gap) is T4 stated as
typing: within one jurisdiction, b and s̄ are not separately identified.

**Open branch.** M4-F9 measured occasion spreading (B8−B1 long-window
difference −0.0163, CI [−0.0559, +0.0233]) and found no gain. T4-simple
predicts spreading helps only via h/τ_s; whether F9's arms changed h/τ_s or
only the arrangement inside a fixed span decides between **T4-simple** and
**T4-reader-mediated** (the gauge itself is state-inclusive: M4-F6 showed the
gauge is B-invariant, 0.0297–0.0365). That derivation from persisted F6/F9
artifacts is K2's Part 0 and the theory's first internal falsification
opportunity. [OPEN]

### T5 — No anchor-free reading [PRINCIPLE]

Every reader anchors somewhere, and each anchor has a price:

| reader | anchor | price |
|---|---|---|
| absolute (card) | issuer estimate μ̂ | sampling error, O_p(1/√|P|) (T3e) |
| relational (configuration/NN) | co-present gallery | composition dependence: decisions change with who else is read |
| coordinate | representation U | basis dependence (the M4-H territory) |

Conjecture **C-NFI** ("no free issuer"): no reader is invariant to all three.
Stated, not proved. K1 measures the first two prices on the same worlds.

### T6 — The discriminator: deviation is identity iff it reproduces [DEFINITIONAL + measured instances]

**Id(i | F) := the occasion-resample-stable component of d(i,·).**

- Positive instance [IMPORTED]: the author axis is a validated law — M4-F4,
  γ=1.096 [0.984, 1.218], ×32 holdout predicted 0.4012 / observed 0.3861.
- Negative instance [IMPORTED]: the S4 residual — M4-H6, 0/3 worlds clear the
  repetition-shuffled null (knife-edge −0.0009 in the closest) — deviation
  with nothing reproducible is NOT identity and cannot be captured by any
  basis.

C-1 is retained exactly in this form: the structured residual is the
reproducible part; the rest is honest noise. The per-person readability ρ_i is
itself a person-level coordinate (the "biometric menagerie" coordinate):
**how legible one's card is, is part of one's identity.**

### T7 — Direction reads, magnitude gauges [PROVED noiseless; noisy form → K3]

With all other cards fixed: per-person directional scaling c_i ↦ αc_i (α>1)
never decreases person i's nearest-neighbor margin; norm-preserving rotation
by angle φ degrades the match with the person's own reproducible direction as
cos φ. The certificate is carried by **direction on the invariant layer**;
magnitude is partly gauge (T1) and partly a real individuation coordinate
(distinctiveness). The face-space caricature effect is this theorem in another
literature's clothing.

### T8 — Similarity geometry: when are "deviation-close" people "pattern-close"? [PROVED in card space; estimator form → K3]

This answers C-4.

- (a) **Decomposition (law of cosines).**
  ‖c_i − c_j‖² = (r_i − r_j)² + 2 r_i r_j (1 − cos θ_ij).
  Raw deviation distance conflates **magnitude mismatch** with **direction
  mismatch** — the profile-similarity elevation/scatter/shape problem
  (Cronbach–Gleser), restated in card space.
- (b) **Anti-direction bound.**
  cos θ_ij < 0 ⟺ ‖c_i − c_j‖² > r_i² + r_j².
  An opposite-direction pair is therefore ALWAYS farther from each other than
  either is from the norm (‖c_i − c_j‖ > max(r_i, r_j)). Contrapositive: if
  two people are mutually closer than either is to the group norm, their
  directions cannot be opposite; for r_i = r_j = r, mutual distance < r forces
  θ < 60°. **The feared case — "distance-close but direction-opposite" —
  exists only in the near-norm regime (both r small).**
- (c) **And exactly there, direction is unreadable.** Direction-estimate
  fidelity degrades as r/σ_noise → 0; two independent noise vectors in R^m
  have cos = O_p(m^{−1/2}) (spurious near-orthogonality); distances among
  near-norm people concentrate (spurious "everyone average looks alike"). The
  paradox dissolves into a power statement: **where distance and direction can
  disagree, neither is readable; where identity is readable, distance-close
  implies direction-close up to the explicit magnitude term in (a).**
- (d) **The licensed similarity estimator.** "Personality closeness" is
  **disattenuated distinctive shape similarity**:
  cos(ĉ_i, ĉ_j) computed on reproducible components (T6), on the invariant
  layer (T2), divided by √(ρ_i ρ_j) (attenuation correction). Magnitude match
  (r_i vs r_j) is a SEPARATE coordinate (individuation match), and readability
  (ρ_i, ρ_j) a third. Three coordinates, never folded into one distance.
- (e) **Identification consequence.** Misidentification is driven by ANGULAR
  crowding of the gallery near c_i's direction, not by raw-distance crowding.

## 5. Registered predictions (the K-line)

- **K1 (registered 2026-08-09, dispatched).** L1 designed card-space
  cancellation (0 decision flips across norm arms in shared design, ≤1e-9);
  L2 issuer error live and monotone in |P| in free design; L3 the 1/|P|
  variance law (manipulation check); L4 issuer-quality × design interaction
  (the penalty is free-design-specific); L5 the deployed relational gauge's
  issuer leakage is bounded: |Δ agreement| < 0.0065408 (= 0.25 × F2's
  composition effect) under calibrated pre-map common occasion shifts.
  Registration with leans, pivots, gates, MDE and aggregation rules:
  `docs/SUICA_M4_K_IDENTITY_LINE_PLAN.md`.
- **K2 (charter).** The card/biography gap law in h/τ_s at fixed budget;
  Part 0 reconciles T4 with F9/F6 at artifact precision and computes the
  T4-point-prediction for F9's exact parameters BEFORE any new run; decides
  T4-simple vs T4-reader-mediated.
- **K3 (charter).** The T7/T8 package: caricature (α) vs rotation (φ)
  dissociation; the anti-direction bound as a designed identity plus its
  violation rate in ESTIMATED cards as a pure noise function; disattenuated
  distinctive cosine recovers generator-true pattern similarity where raw
  distance fails (near-norm and unequal-norm regimes, sign-predictable);
  angular vs distance crowding; ρ_i predicts per-person identification.

## 6. What IDT answers to the origin conjecture

- **C-1 upheld, with the discriminator.** Identity is the reproducible
  component of deviation; the non-reproducing remainder is honest noise
  (measured instances on both sides: F4 vs H6).
- **C-2 converted into structure.** Unmeasurable at n=1 within one
  jurisdiction (F10); measurable across occasions at a lawful rate (the
  F4-type growth law); magnitude forever frame-bound (T1's trichotomy);
  pattern frame-stable on the invariant layer (T2).
- **C-3 sharpened.** Certificates have an issuer (P), a jurisdiction (O), and
  an expiry (h) — there is no issuer-free ID. Relative identity is issuer-free
  (T3); absolute identity is not. The readable card is state-inclusive (T4):
  it is a real certificate, occasion-stamped, and it is not a biography.
- **C-4 answered by T8.** "Same personality" = shape similarity of
  reproducible deviations after disattenuation, reported alongside — never
  merged with — magnitude match and readability. Raw distance alone is not a
  licensed similarity reading. The opposite-direction fear is confined by the
  anti-direction bound to the near-norm regime, where nothing is readable
  anyway.

## 8. Ethics note

If the residual is the identity, then content-scrubbing is not anonymization:
T6+T3 imply re-identification from deviation patterns that carry almost no
content. This binds to program governance: no per-person claims at this tier;
synthetic worlds only; the deanonymization consequence is to be treated in the
deferred defense phase, not exploited here.

## 9. Scope and tier

EXPLORATORY. Synthetic worlds calibrated to the real-text regime, through the
deployed frozen machinery. IDT licenses grammar — typing rules, design priors,
reader constructions, refusals — and no claim about any corpus, construct,
person, or diagnosis. The claims ledger controls.

## Dated appendix A (2026-08-09, planner derivation, same day as v1): T6′ — the discriminator has a split-scheme gauge, and that gauge is a measurement channel

T6 defines Id(i|F) as the occasion-resample-stable component of the deviation
field. Derivation: **which component is "stable" depends on the resampling
scheme**, because slow state is shared or separated by the split design:

- **Interleaved splits** (odd/even occasions): both halves sample the same
  state eras → s̄ is SHARED between halves → the "reproducible" component is
  b + s̄ (the occasion-bound card, state included).
- **Contiguous splits** (first half vs last half): state drift sits BETWEEN
  the halves → if the half-span exceeds τ_s, s̄ decorrelates across halves →
  the "reproducible" component approaches b alone.

So T6 as stated in v1 was under-specified: Id(i|F) requires a DECLARED split
scheme, and the scheme is part of the frame's expiry structure (h). This is
not a defect but a channel:

**T6′ (two-split state probe).** ρ_interleaved(i) − ρ_contiguous(i) is a
per-person, card-level, reader-free estimator of the state share of person
i's card at horizon h — the certificate's expiry date read off the difference
between two split designs. In-generator it is exactly predictable from the
same AR algebra as T4(b); on real designs it needs no access to the truth.

Consequence for K2: the leg becomes a TWO-CHANNEL discrimination with an
internal positive control (see plan-doc K2 charter refinement of this date).

## Dated appendix B (2026-08-09, planner derivation): F9 reconciliation — T4-simple is NOT tested by F9, and the branch stays open on purpose

Registered question: does F9's null (B8−B1 long-window = −0.01632278580727804,
CI [−0.05594321814077245, +0.02329764652621637], κ=0.5, gap=40, m_common=8,
AR(1) φ∈[0.2,0.8], authors ×16 — artifact precision, re-verified today)
falsify T4-simple, which predicts occasion spreading improves trait recovery?

Derivation (arithmetic verified before committing this note):

1. The arrangement manipulation is REAL at card level: Var(s̄)/σ_s² for one
   contiguous block of 8 is 0.17773 (φ=.2) / 0.31274 (φ=.5) / 0.60486 (φ=.8)
   vs 0.12500 for 8 gap-40 singletons — a 1.42×–4.84× reduction.
2. But the long-window baseline it acts on is tiny: r(B1) = 0.05963369493652382.
   Under the attenuation form r = σ_b/√(σ_b²+V), the predicted B8 gain is
   +0.0716 ONLY under the absurd bound (ALL card variance is state at φ=.8 —
   excluded by the generator's own weights, w_e=.70); +0.0116 under a generous
   half-state budget; **+0.0029 at the generator-plausible x-channel weight
   (w_x=.15)**. Every physically plausible prediction sits deep inside F9's CI
   (half-width 0.0396; power against +0.003–.012 is ~5–10%).

**Verdict: F9's pivot rightly closed the PANEL question (no affordable trait
axis via arrangement), but as a test of T4's mechanism it is structurally
uninformative — the arrangement lever is too weak at this state share, not
wrong.** T4-simple vs T4-reader-mediated remains open and moves to K2, whose
design must manipulate the state SHARE and persistence (α, τ_s), where
T4-simple's predicted swing can be made ≥3× the MDE — not the arrangement at
a fixed tiny share, where no affordable world count discriminates.

Two annotations, flagged as post-hoc readings of persisted numbers (they
become predictions only if K2 registers them fresh):

- F9 lean (b): same-occasion recovery DROPPED significantly under spread
  (−0.03173098873449674, CI [−0.05238696612924556, −0.01107501133974793]).
  T4(a)'s watermark reading fits the sign: at B1 the state era is coherent —
  the state-inclusive object is sharp and same-occasion recovery profits from
  it; at B8 the object averages 8 decorrelated eras and blurs. The state was
  subsidizing the same-occasion reading.
- F9's long-window row (0.0596, 0.0495, 0.0785, 0.0433 across B=1,2,4,8) is
  non-monotone at se≈0.01 — the signature of a floor plus noise, consistent
  with (not probative of) a reader-set floor.

## Dated appendix C (2026-08-09, after M4-K1): T3(f) decided AGAINST the idealization — the deployed gauge AMPLIFIES the frame; and T6 is forgeable without frame refreshment

M4-K1 executed (agent commit 10cea75; adjudication in the plan doc). What it
did to the theory:

**C.1 — What survived, at machine precision.** The card-space layer is fully
intact. T3(a–c): 0 rank-1 decision flips out of 31,520 probe cells across all
five norm arms (0 ties excluded), card-difference matrices invariant to
4.09e-16 / 4.14e-16 against a 1e-9 bar — with norms actually subtracted, no
algebraic shortcut. T3(e)'s issuer price on a deployable absolute reader is
large, lawful, and free-design-specific: oracle − est8 = +0.09695431472081219,
CI [0.08819796954314721, 0.10596763959390862], 8/8 worlds, 6.3× MDE; the
1/|P| law lands at slope −1.0865327686128703, CI [−1.0990, −1.0735]; the
design × issuer-quality interaction is +0.022461928934010153, CI
[0.011796, 0.032487], 7/8.

**C.2 — What died: T3(f).** Structural audit (G2) returned Branch B: the
deployed gauge consumes norm position directly (absolute means and quantiles,
quadratic lag products, tanh currents, a fixed D0 standardizer). And L5
MISSED with a POSITIVE sign: a pre-map common occasion shift — content no
card-space contrast can see — INCREASES the gauge's split-half agreement:
Δ = +0.015881141 at 0.5× (CI [0.003953, 0.027809]), **+0.092543049 at 1× (CI
[0.057781, 0.127306]) — 3.54× the entire F2 composition effect** — and
+0.549686516 at the 2× stress arm, while free designs are inert (|Δ| ≤
0.0045). The deployed relational gauge is not issuer-robust; it is
**issuer-amplifying**: shared-frame content is read as agreement. T5's price
table gains a line — the relational reader's price is not only gallery
composition but amplification of shared-frame content into apparent identity
consistency.

**C.3 — Annotation to §4's F2 retrodiction row (annotation, not rewrite).**
The ownership of F2's +0.026163263306726227 is now genuinely open: F2's
shared arms contain NATIVE common structure (w_mu = 0.15, the same scale
class as the author channel w_x = 0.15), and the gauge responds to a 1×
common shift with 3.54× the whole effect. Until M4-K1b decomposes it, the F2
row licenses only "composition changes what the gauge reads" — NOT
"composition improves author reading". The D3 design prior inherits this
caveat.

**C.4 — T6″ (frame-refreshed discriminator).** K1's disclosed by-product:
under the T3(c)-hypothesis reader in the free design, issuer sampling error
becomes a person-specific, occasion-half-REPRODUCIBLE component that IMPROVES
re-identification (est8 beats oracle: pooled −0.050127, CI [−0.056726,
−0.043782], 0/8 in the registered direction, monotone the wrong way) — **a
forged identity that passes T6's own discriminator**, manufactured by issuer
error interacting with person-specific occasion sampling. Patch, now part of
the theory and under test as K1b lean L-d: **Id(i|F) requires stability under
JOINT resampling of occasions AND frame** (the issuer re-estimated
independently per replicate). Reproducibility measured under a shared frame
is forgeable; reproducibility under frame refreshment is the licensed
discriminator.

**C.5 — Reader-design lemma (informal, from the same by-product).** A
split-half re-identification reader cannot simultaneously satisfy T3(c)'s
common-norm hypothesis and remove the occasion effect; the two constructions
are inequivalent instruments. Every constructed reader must declare which it
is (plan-doc standing rule 9). Input to K3.

## Dated appendix D (2026-08-09, after M4-K1b): the composition effect at κ=1.0 is frame-owned by construction; T9 (the forgery principle); T6″ v2

**D.1 — Frame ownership proved, not estimated.** K1b's registered surgery
turned out to be an identity at κ=1.0: removing the occasion-common structure
makes the shared and free designs the SAME panel — nothing else distinguishes
them — so Ŝ ≡ 1 exactly (CI width ~1e-16). The rule-9 second reading supplied
the live dissociation: deleting every trace of author identity DOUBLES the
composition contrast (Δ1′ = +0.04709060297774369 [0.042167, 0.052023],
32/32); the author-reading share of F2's κ=1.0 effect is
**−0.9487481378268351 [−1.1584, −0.7532]**; author deletion RAISES shared
agreement (+0.023006, 31/32); the free design reads zero with or without
authors. **At κ=1.0, composition's gain is entirely shared-frame content, and
author content is a net drag.** (Consistent with M4-F7's coefficient-0
finding, whose attribution consequence had never been propagated to F2's
headline.) The κ=0.5 knob — where the author channel is live — is K1c's
question, and no claim is made about it here.

**D.2 — T9, the forgery principle (two levels, one genus).** [MEASURED at
κ=1.0; live-knob form under test in K1c.] Frame content forges
identity-like statistics at both levels the theory cares about:

- *individual*: issuer error × person-specific sampling manufactures a
  person-stable, occasion-half-reproducible component that IMPROVES
  re-identification (appendix C.4; replicated at fresh seeds in K1b:
  +0.058756 [0.052284, 0.065355], 8/8) — a forged card;
- *collective*: shared occasions inject common content that the deployed
  gauge reads as agreement (the whole κ=1.0 composition effect) — a forged
  consensus.

Reproducibility and agreement statistics are frame-forgeable. The licensed
counter-operations are **frame refreshment** (individual level: the forgery
is destroyed and inverts into an honest issuer penalty, −0.062310
[−0.071069, −0.054188], 0/8) and **frame removal/contrast** (collective
level: K1b's surgery). A statistic that has passed neither operation may not
be read as identity content.

**D.3 — T6″ v2 (sign form).** The v1 operationalization (zero-equivalence
band after refreshment) was a planner rule-4 violation: under refreshment the
expected value is NOT zero but the honest issuer-noise penalty. Correct form:
**under frame refreshment, no reader may PROFIT from frame error** —
est-frame minus oracle must be ≤ 0 within tolerance; a positive advantage
under refreshed frames is the forgery signature. The measured inversion
(−0.0623) with oracle stability 0.00254 vindicates the direction and the
do-no-harm clause. Confirmatory lean at the live knob rides K1c (L-e″).

**D.4 — The de-framing repair (certified, unadopted).** Per-occasion
ESTIMATED mean subtraction pre-map removes **94.389% [90.233, 98.791]** of
what oracle common-structure removal removes (K1b L-e HOLD, 32/32 on both
removals). Realizable outside synthetic worlds; UNADOPTED under F16
discipline (changing the frozen gauge is a new operator with its own study
ID); queues beside `colstd_alpha_0.10`.

**D.5 — §4 F2 row, second annotation.** The κ=1.0 attribution is CLOSED
(frame-owned, proved by construction and by live author-deletion). The κ=0.5
attribution is OPEN → K1c. Retrospective dated notes with this scope were
appended today to the M4-F panel synthesis and the displacement-resolution
document under P2b's registered consequence.

## Dated appendix E (2026-08-09, after M4-K1c's Part-0 stop): the world-family lemma — composition in F2's family is common-channel-carried at EVERY κ, and the person×occasion channel does not exist there

M4-K1c never ran its arms: its rule-10 gate proved the planner's registered
frame-share decomposition degenerate at EVERY κ, not only at κ=1.0, and
stopped the leg in 74 seconds with zero adjudicated worlds (P4c).

**E.1 — The lemma (source-proved, empirically exact).** In F2's
`generate_world_composed`: the design (`occasion_mode`) has exactly one
consumer, `occasion_labels → shock_x` — the `common_part`. The `mean_part`,
`ar_part` and `noise_part` are drawn before the design enters and are
design-invariant; `state_part` is linear in the blend, so
**response − common_part is design-invariant for every κ ∈ (0,1]**
(empirically: shared-vs-free gaps of the other three channels exactly 0.0;
post-removal panels equal at 3.3e-16; through the deployed gauge |Δ1| ≤
7.81e-17 across all pilot worlds). Consequences: (i) Ŝ_frame ≡ 1 at every κ
is a fact about the WORLD, not a gauge measurement — K1b's κ=1.0 attribution
was correct but too narrow; (ii) exact common-removal is a design-collapsing
operation in this family at any κ (standing rules 10 and 12 exist because
two planner registrations in a row missed this).

**E.2 — What this does to IDT's A1.** F2's family instantiates s(i,o) only
in its degenerate corner: s(i,o) = common(o) + AR_i(t). There is **no
person×occasion interaction channel**. The jurisdiction-alignment question —
"does shared-occasion design align PERSON-SPECIFIC state content?" — is
therefore UNTESTABLE in this family: not falsified, not supported —
inexpressible. T3(e)'s two free-design penalties collapse into one there.
(This is also why the panel line's laws should be re-read as laws of a
family without if-then signatures: the world cannot represent the very
object Shoda-style behavioral signatures are about.)

**E.3 — Consequences downstream.** (a) K2 gains a fifth design requirement:
introduce a person×occasion interaction channel (`w_int`) so state share,
alignment, and the two-split probe act on a world that can express them.
(b) The only live ownership question inside the existing family is Ŝ_auth
(author-deletion), which is NOT degenerate (A5-vs-A6 panel gap
0.3310376783451957 — exactly the design gap) — registered as M4-K1c′.
(c) K1c's report-only κ facts: F4's adjudicated claims are κ=1.0-only by its
own record; F5 carries a HELD κ-stability lean. The F4/F5 re-reading remains
queued as its own registration; this appendix does not annotate them.

**E.4 — Method note.** Rule 10's gate converted a wrong registration into a
74-second stop — the first time a standing rule caught the planner before
compute was spent. Rule 12 (source-object naming for channels and
manipulations) was added after two same-family naming defects.

## Dated appendix F (2026-08-09, after M4-K1c′): the negative author share is κ-invariant; author content is interference; the repair is knob-dependent

**F.1 — The share.** At the live knob (κ=0.5; author channels CERTIFIED live:
AR intact/zeroed ratio ~1.08, author-mean ratio ~2.86), with the composition
effect itself replicating INSIDE F2's own CI (Δ0 = 0.007448566560020627
[0.006338, 0.008586] vs F2's [0.004418, 0.013254]):
**Ŝ_auth = −0.9443843417103447 [−1.2340432099315712, −0.7045965411263232]**
— the same number to three decimals as K1b's −0.949 at κ=1.0. Deleting every
trace of author identity nearly doubles the composition contrast
(Δ0′/Δ0 = 1.944; Δ0′ positive in 127/128 worlds). The negative share is not
a κ=1.0 artefact.

**F.2 — Author content is interference, decomposed.** The exact identity
(Δ0 − Δ0′) = −[(A5−A0) + (A2−A6)] (verified at 3.5e-18) splits the effect:
deleting authors RAISES shared-design agreement (A5−A0 = +0.004338666343079094,
92/128) and LOWERS free-design agreement (A6−A2 = −0.0026956432843916727,
90/128). In both designs author content interferes with the gauge's frame
reading rather than feeding it. Note also the panel-level fact: at this knob
(A5−A6) ≡ (A0−A2) AS PANELS — the deletion subtracts a design-invariant
object — so the entire Ŝ_auth story is GAUGE-level, exactly where T9 says
forgery lives.

**F.3 — T9 status: measured at both knobs.** Individual forgery at κ=0.5:
+0.0547 (8/8) under a shared frame → **−0.0867 (0/8)** under frame
refreshment (a larger inversion than κ=1.0's −0.0623), oracle stable at
0.0019. T6″ v2 (sign form) HOLDS at both knobs.

**F.4 — The de-framing repair is knob-dependent.** R_est/R_or =
**0.7347 [0.6376, 0.8207] at κ=0.5** vs **0.9439 [0.9023, 0.9879] at κ=1.0**
— non-overlapping. Deployment caveat recorded on the certified-unadopted
repair: its removal fraction is regime-dependent and must be re-measured in
any target regime before an adoption decision.

**F.5 — What remains of "composition", and the next question.** The
phenomenon is real (replicates inside F2's CI), frame-owned at every tested
knob, with author content as interference. The surviving design content of
"recruit authors, not words" is now a single question: does M4-F4's scaling
exponent (γ = 1.096) survive author deletion? If yes, the author axis is a
REPLICATE axis (frame-readout economics — more noise-bodies averaging the
same frame); if no, scaling and composition ownership dissociate. Registered
as M4-K1d before run.

## Dated appendix G (2026-08-09, after M4-K1d): the author axis is a replicate axis; interference extends from level to slope

**G.1 — The result.** At F4's own knob (κ=1.0, shared), fresh seeds, F4's own
fitter: the law replicates strongly (γ_intact = 1.1187 [0.9810, 1.2376] —
the fresh CI CONTAINS F4's whole band), and **survives total deletion of the
author channel**: γ_deleted = 1.2446 [1.1185, 1.3579], overlapping F4's band
under every reading. Δγ = +0.1259 [0.0169, 0.2483] — inside the registered
±0.25 immateriality band, **boundary-seated** (registered B=2000 reading
holds by 0.0017; a 100000-draw reading lands outside by 0.0017; the positive
SIGN is robust at 10/10 seeds). L-1 HOLD under its registration; every
consequence carries the boundary status; standing rule 13 (Monte-Carlo
verdict stability) was created from this.

**G.2 — Interference, now at the slope.** Deleting the authors RAISES the
level at every scale (40/40 world-points; +0.0120 at ×1 growing to +0.2095
at ×16), steepens the exponent, predicts BETTER out-of-sample on F4's own
×32 protocol (holdout gap 0.0490 deleted vs 0.0807 intact), and **more than
halves the half-agreement budget (48.865× → 19.878× authors)**. The axis
named after authors is cheaper and cleaner without them. With K1b/K1c′ this
completes the arc: author content is interference to the deployed gauge's
frame reading at the composition LEVEL and at the scaling SLOPE. **The
"author axis" is a replicate axis: frame-readout economics, where any
noise-bodies averaging the same frame would serve.** The D3 prior re-types:
recruit replicates, not words.

**G.3 — F5's truth objects are mixed (source-derived fact, K1d G-info-F5).**
`truth_recovery_exact/long` in F5 are field agreements against noise-free
mixtures: at κ=1.0 exactly **½ author-mean + ½ occasion-common**; at κ=0.5
**¾ author (½ mean + ¼ AR) + ¼ common** (noise, 70% of response variance,
excluded). Every F5 "truth recovery" number is recovery of that mixture, not
of a trait. Recorded so no reader mistakes it; any re-adjudication of F5's
rows would be its own registered leg. This composition table is also a
required input to K2b's T4-branch reading.

**G.4 — Method.** Defects #16 (a gate unmeasurable at its registered
position) and #17 (a pivot space with a gap exactly where the measurement
landed) recorded; rule 13 added; the legacy-parser naming convention added
for pre-round-trip artifacts.

**G.5 — What the K-line still owes.** K2a (instrument: expressive world with
slow state + person×occasion channel; two-split probe validated against
designed identities — registered, dispatched), then K2b (the T4 branch:
simple vs reader-mediated, on the validated instrument), then K3 (similarity
geometry, T7/T8), then the line synthesis.

## Dated appendix H (2026-08-09, after M4-K2a): the instrument holds — T6′ and the attenuation algebra are now measured objects

M4-K2a validated the expressive world and both card-level instruments
against Part-0 point predictions computed before any arm (10.9 s of
compute, card-space only):

- **T6′ (two-split probe) is real and quantitative:** measured
  ρ_interleaved − ρ_contiguous contained the algebraic prediction in 11/12
  cells and matched the predicted ORDERING exactly — including its
  non-monotonicity in φ_slow and an arm-dependent rank swap. The probe
  reads τ_s.
- **Appendix B's attenuation formula is exact in practice:** 12/12 cells,
  max relative error 0.30%, against r = σ_b/√(σ_b² + Var(s̄_slow) +
  Var(s̄_int) + σ_e²/n_eff) with the exact AR sum.
- **The person×occasion channel is typed correctly:** its contribution to
  contiguous-split reproducibility is 0 within margins (6/6, TOST, even at
  the strictest submargin) while its same-occasion signature is present and
  matches the predicted magnitude (6/6) — the family can now express the
  content appendix E showed it lacked.
- **Rule 13's first application:** six boundary-near clauses triggered the
  ≥10×B stability check; all STABLE; zero BOUNDARY.
- **Estimator lesson (binding rider on K2b):** read the GAP, not either
  split half — the authors-within-world bootstrap conditions on realized
  occasion shocks and under-covers half-level predictions (8/12), while GAP
  and attenuation quantities are immune.

Status change: T6′ and the attenuation algebra move from [PROVED in card
space] to **[MEASURED]**. K2b (the T4 branch) is registered and dispatched
on this instrument.

## Dated appendix I (2026-08-09, after M4-K2b): the T4 branch returns PARTIAL — and a third form is named

**I.1 — The verdict.** On the validated instrument, with the positive
control EXACT (6/6 + 6/6 containment; both card orderings exactly as
predicted, and different from each other — the card resolves the φ effect),
the deployed gauge's b-only trait recovery does NEITHER registered thing:
it does not track card algebra proportionally (L-B MISS: Spearman 0.943
with one non-significant inversion, p = .0083 > .005; S/P = 0.381 outside
[0.5, 2]) and it is not floored (L-C MISS on the point clause by 1.5–1.7
se). **PARTIAL fires — both mechanisms live.** T4 stays [OPEN].

**I.2 — The discovery: over-response.** Field recovery falls **−57.6%**
across the design while card algebra prescribes **−32.5%**; against an
arm-independent efficiency λ = 0.1742, S/(λP) = **2.19**. The reader loses
the trait FASTER than the card does — qualitatively the interference
account's prediction (appendices F/G) appearing on the state axis. Named as
the third candidate form: **T4-reader-amplified**. Also L-D HOLD: the gauge
recovers the MIXTURE better than the trait in 6/6 arms (2.7× at the highest
state share) — the frame-preference again.

**I.3 — The method lesson (rule 14).** The registration compared card
attenuation to field agreement without pinning the LINK between their
scales, and the branch verdict is link-sensitive (identity link → PARTIAL;
squared link → MEDIATED). Scored on the pre-declared primary; defect #20;
**rule 14**: cross-scale leans pin their link, or are redesigned
within-instrument. K2c is the within-instrument design: matched-attenuation
pairs — same predicted card attenuation, different state composition; any
within-pair field difference is composition-sensitivity, measured
field-vs-field, no link anywhere.

**I.4 — What K2c decides.** L-1: field is a function of attenuation alone →
**T4-simple-with-link** (over-response = link curvature; appendix G's slope
claim would be REVISED accordingly). L-2: composition-sensitivity at fixed
attenuation → **T4-reader-mediated (composition form)**, and the
constructive repair test (does de-framing raise trait recovery?) follows.
Registered before run with a partitioned space and equivalence margins.

## Dated appendix J (2026-08-09, after M4-K2c): the strict function form is dead, the link is quadratic, and the composition term is real but small — so far

**J.1 — Composition-sensitivity is real; the strict function form is
falsified.** With within-pair predicted attenuation matched to 1e-16 and
measured matches 23×–143× inside the gate, the field still differs:
unanimous sign across three pairs, 2/3 significant at n=32, monotone in
state content (|D| = 2.08% / 9.65% / 15.23% of level; the more-share /
less-persistent arm reads the person worse). The field is NOT a function of
card attenuation alone.

**J.2 — But sub-material at the registered margin** (all |D| CIs inside
±0.020) over attenuation 0.56–0.78 — with the record keeping the honest
clause: the MARGIN, not the physics, kept the function form's equivalence
alive (closest case by 0.533 se). The registered space turned out not to be
a partition (significant-but-sub-material satisfied both leans; scored as a
named non-registered outcome under a pre-declared rule; T4 not re-typed).
Defect #21; standing rule 15 (enumeration-verified partitions) created.

**J.3 — The link is measured: q = 1.9338 [1.7337, 2.1933], R² 0.958 over
13 arms.** The K2b over-response is approximately QUADRATIC — the reader
loses the trait like the square of the card's attenuation. This
retroactively explains K2b's link-sensitivity: the squared reading was
close to the truth. Emerging named form (hypothesis, not adjudicated):
**field ≈ λ·r_card^q − c(state composition)**, q ≈ 2, c > 0 growing with
state content, carrier unresolved (iso-attenuation pairs in (share, φ)
move both together).

**J.4 — The trade.** At matched attenuation, the mixture channel moves
OPPOSITE and 4.3× larger (all CIs excluding 0): what the reader gains on
the mixture it loses on the trait — T9's frame-preference, now visible as
a within-pair exchange rate.

**J.5 — K2d (registered).** Frontier: does c() cross materiality at
attenuation ≈ 0.45? Carrier: species pairs trading slow-AR against the
K2a-validated interaction channel at matched attenuation and fixed φ —
species-general vs species-specific, with the sign itself a finding. Dual
margins (0.020 continuity; 0.010 = the observed effect scale, so
sub-material can no longer hide effects of the size already seen);
rule-15 enumeration as the adjudication space. Either closure re-types T4;
the constructive repair question follows the ownership.

## Dated appendix K (2026-08-09, after M4-K2d): the composition term peaks; the species term is material; one coefficient explains everything so far

**K.1 — The (share, φ) composition axis is bounded by its own peak.** At
attenuation 0.45 the term is SUB-SIG(−) (−0.0099 [−0.0154, −0.0046]): the
relative effect kept growing (2.08 → 9.65 → 15.23 → 15.94% of level) but
the level collapsed faster — the ABSOLUTE term peaked near r ≈ 0.56 and
fell 27% by the frontier. This axis never crosses materiality anywhere on
the tested curve, and not because of margin generosity.

**K.2 — The material term is the SPECIES.** At matched attenuation AND
matched φ, replacing persistent author-state with occasion-bound
interaction content costs 2.0–2.5× more trait recovery: SP-68
+0.0304 [+0.0235, +0.0369], SP-56 +0.0271 [+0.0203, +0.0338] — both
MAT-SIG(+) under both margins; the first MATERIAL composition finding of
the series. Gloss (flagged as gloss): occasion-KEYED person content looks
like frame to a frame-preferring reader — it is read into the mixture and
subtracted from the person; T9's grammar, now with a price tag.

**K.3 — The unifying candidate.** One coefficient fits all six K2c+K2d
pairs, including the sign reversal: **D ≈ −0.722 × Δ(total non-trait
person variance)**, R² 0.9935, max residual 0.0025. Candidate law:
**field ≈ λ·r_card^q − κ·V_person** — the reader taxes RAW person
variance, species-blind; K2d's species result would then be ΔV in
disguise. K2d cannot separate them (species and ΔV confounded); K2e's
double-matched pairs (attenuation AND V_person matched, species free) are
the link-free discriminator, with the −0.722 slope promoted to a
registered quantitative prediction on a fresh pair. Under H-VAR the T4
closure would read: **T4-reader-amplified-variance** — the reader loses
the trait like r^q and pays a further tax proportional to total person
state, whatever its species.

**K.4 — Method.** Rule 15 held at the cell level and caught its own
registration one level up (lean predicates and pivot routing
unpartitioned — defect #22 → rule 16: the enumeration covers the FULL
adjudication object). Pilot convention tightened (≥4 worlds or df
inflation — K2d's 2-world pilots underestimated realized sd by up to
7.8×, disclosed, inconsequential there). Instrument boundary recorded:
K2a's two-split GAP predictions are validated only to equal-share w_int;
attenuation predictions held at 0.278% max error even beyond it.

## Dated appendix L (2026-08-09, after M4-K2e): T4 CLOSES — the reader-borne composite form

**L.1 — Double matching decides.** With BOTH predicted attenuation and
total person variance matched to ≤1e-16 (measured: attenuation 6–9×,
V_person 54–85× inside their gates), K2d's "material species effect"
collapses by **67.04–78.83%** — it was ΔV_person in disguise. The variance
law was simultaneously confirmed OUT-OF-SAMPLE on a fresh pure-φ pair:
predicted D = −0.0124, measured −0.0106 [−0.0152, −0.0057], error 0.0019
(both registered clauses). What survives of the species term: SUB-SIG(+)
in both DM pairs (+0.0064 [+0.0007, +0.0121]; +0.0089 [+0.0024, +0.0153])
— genuine, sign-consistent, but sub-material at both margins and below its
own realized MDE (0.74×, 0.95×): replication-fragile.

**L.2 — T4: [OPEN] → [CLOSED, composite reader-borne form].**

    field ≈ λ · r_card^q − κ · V_person − ε_species(occasion-bound)

λ ≈ 0.174; **q = 1.83 [1.71, 1.98]** (the reader loses the trait like the
square of card attenuation); **κ ≈ 0.72** (the reader taxes raw
person-state variance, species-blind, beyond card algebra — quantitatively
predicted and confirmed); **ε_species** bounded ≤ 0.0153 (CI upper) at
these dims, fragile. The card/biography gap is **reader-borne in
substance**: T4-simple survives only as the r-dependence inside a
quadratic link; the flat floor is dead; **the F5 plateau re-attributes to
the reader's own transformations, not to the card's information content.**
Scope as always: this closes the branch for THE DEPLOYED READER on this
world family, EXPLORATORY tier — it is a law about the instrument-world
pair, not about persons.

**L.3 — Method.** Defects #23 (routing consequence written at MAT grade,
fired at SUB grade — executed graded per rule 7) and #24 (a false
conservative premise about the instrument's validated range — rule-8
family) recorded. The 4-world pilot is now a standing convention.

**L.4 — What remains of IDT v1's program.** K3 (T7/T8 similarity geometry
— the empirical stamp on the origin question C-4) is registered and
dispatched; on P4 (all leans hold) the theory's registered empirical
program is COMPLETE and the next planner actions are the line synthesis
and IDT v1.1 consolidation, then K-R1 (the constructive repair test:
does de-framing move λ, κ, or trait recovery — T9's counter-operations
tested constructively).

## Dated appendix M (2026-08-09, after M4-K3): v1.1 consolidation — the theory as measured

K3 returned P3 (QUALIFIED): the registered empirical program of IDT v1 is
COMPLETE. The theorem status table, controlling as of this date:

Answers to the origin conjecture, final form for v1: **C-1** upheld with
the discriminator — and the discriminator itself needed two frame patches
(reproducibility without frame refreshment is forgeable). **C-2** a
theorem (three gauges), not an obstacle. **C-3** exact: certificates have
issuer, jurisdiction, expiry — and the certificate-reader itself is now
priced (quadratic loss + variance tax). **C-4** measured: personality
closeness is direction on the invariant layer, read after reproducibility
and reliability corrections; the feared distance/direction divergence is
confined to the near-norm regime by an exact bound that BINDS in half of
all pairs; and one estimator lesson beyond the conjecture — who gets
misread is set by their own readability, not by their neighbors, in
sparse galleries.

Method ledger for the line: standing rules 9–17 created, each paid for by
a recorded planner defect (#9–#26); the 4-world pilot, round-trip
parsing, Part-0 verification of bit-identity claims, and chunked-stage
conventions adopted. Companion synthesis:
`docs/SUICA_M4_K_IDENTITY_LINE_SYNTHESIS.md`. Scope unchanged:
EXPLORATORY, synthetic, instrument-world laws — no claims about persons.

## Dated appendix N (2026-08-09, after M4-K-R1): the scaffold corollary — de-framing is diagnostic, never preprocessing

K-R1 asked whether the certified de-framing repair improves the reader as
a trait instrument. **It does the opposite, maximally:** b-only recovery
collapses to zero in all six state arms (d_a from −0.077 to −0.183, 0/32
worlds positive anywhere, 6.3–12.3× realized MDE; λ falls 0.1821 →
0.0008). The planner's prior on this branch was .10 — recorded, not
excused.

**N.1 — The scaffold corollary (T9 refined).** In this family the trait
has no frame-free expression in the field: the b-only truth's only
within-author occasion variation IS the frame (strict trait-only fields
are degenerate, context norms ~7e-4). The reader reads the person THROUGH
the person×frame interaction. Therefore frame REMOVAL destroys forged and
legitimate reading together — bleach the paper and the watermark goes with
the forgery. T9's counter-operations are re-licensed: **frame refreshment
and frame CONTRAST are diagnostic operations; frame removal as
preprocessing is prohibited wherever person content lacks frame-free
expression.** (The certified de-framing repair keeps its composition-
deflation certificate and gains this caution.)

**N.2 — Instrument-role typing (T5's table, closing line).** As a TRAIT
instrument at these regimes the plain card reader dominates the deployed
relation-field gauge by ~4.5× (card attenuation 0.827 vs field recovery
0.178 at the lowest state share). The gauge is an occasion-bound-object
instrument — the F-line's wall, now with its mechanism. Reader licensing:
trait questions → card-family readers with frame-refreshed discriminators
(T6″); occasion-bound-object questions → the relational gauge; never the
converse.

## Dated appendix O (2026-08-09): T10 — the anchor impossibility theorem (C-NFI proved, global form)

T5's conjecture C-NFI is now a theorem in its global form.

**T10 (anchor impossibility).** Let a reader assign to a single probe's
card c ∈ R^m an identity reading Φ(c) (any measurable functional), and
require Φ invariant under (i) arbitrary common translations of card space
(the closure of issuer freedom — realized adversarially by biased issuers,
K1's biased32 channel), and (ii) positive scalar coordinate changes. Then
Φ is constant: translation-invariance alone forces Φ(c) = Φ(c − c) = Φ(0)
for every c. A constant reading carries no identity information.
Consequently every informative reader either (a) consumes an issuer
estimate — paying issuer-sampling error, measured at +0.0970 (6.3×MDE)
with the 1/|P| law at slope −1.0865 (K1) — or (b) reads multi-person
structure, i.e., the centered configuration, which is invariant to common
translations but depends by construction on WHO is co-present — paying
gallery composition — or (c) anchors in fixed coordinates, paying basis
dependence (the M4-H territory, 45.79% materiality). **There is no
anchor-free reading; the three prices are exhaustive at the level of what
a reading may consume.**

Local form (stated, not proved): under sampling issuers (error
O(σ/√|P|)) rather than adversarial ones, the impossibility becomes an
information bound — identity information through the absolute channel is
capped by issuer precision; K1's L2/L3 measurements are this bound's
empirical shadow. The local constant is not derived here.

Status: T5 upgrades from PRICED (C-NFI conjecture) to **PRICED + T10
PROVED (global)**. The certificate metaphor closes exactly: there is no
ID without an issuer, no line-up without a gallery, no reading without
coordinates — only the choice of which price to pay, and the prices are
now measured.

## Dated appendix P (2026-08-09, evening): IDT-R — the reverse reading. Typology, identity removal, and what "error = 0" asserts

Origin (program owner, same date): *the old hypothesis — assuming error = 0
is assuming there is no identity; conversely, if identity were REMOVED,
would correct personality GROUPING become possible? Can this be proven?*

**P.1 — The figure-ground inversion.** Extend A1 with a TYPE layer:

    x(i,o) = μ(o) + τ_{g(i)} + b_i + s(i,o) + ε(i,o)

where g(i) ∈ {1..G} is a latent group, τ_g the type vector (shared within
a group), and b_i the WITHIN-TYPE individual identity (deviation from
one's own type centroid). The K-line read b as the signal and everything
shared as frame; the reverse reading takes τ as the signal and b as
interference. This is the **complementarity principle**, third
instantiation: every layer (frame / type / identity / state / noise) is
signal for exactly one question and interference for the others; a reader
must declare its target layer, and suppression operations are only valid
for the structure they exploit (averaging kills ε; frame refreshment
kills s and issuer forgeries; cross-person pooling reveals τ; and b has
NO intrinsic suppression operation — which is exactly why typology is
hard in identity-bearing worlds, and why identity was the hard signal in
the K-line).

**P.2 — Theorem R1 (circularity, and its resolution). [PROVED]**
"Remove identity, then group" is circular as stated: b_i is DEFINED as
c_i − τ_{g(i)}, so removing it requires knowing g — the very output of
grouping. Made algorithmic, the proposal is exactly alternating
minimization: (given groups, estimate identities as residuals and remove
them) ⇄ (given identity-removed cards — the centroids — re-group). This
is Lloyd's algorithm / EM for a mixture. Consequently: (i) the
procedure's fixed points are the local optima of the joint
type+assignment objective — the conjecture cannot be proven as an
unconditional algorithm, because its algorithmic form inherits
clustering's local-optimum structure; (ii) it IS provably correct in the
separation regime of R2. The owner's proposal, formalized, is the E-step
read as an identity operation — and that identification is itself the
first result.

**P.3 — Theorem R2 (the geometry dichotomy — when identity removal is
possible without knowing groups). [PROVED, sketch]** Let cards be
c_i = τ_{g(i)} + b_i + η_i with types supported in a k_τ-dimensional
subspace S of R^m, minimum centroid separation Δ.

- **ISO case** (identity isotropic: energy σ_b² spread over all m
  dimensions): distance-based grouping suffers the FULL identity energy
  (within-type squared distances inflate by ~2σ_b²), but projection onto
  S (estimable from the top of the pooled spectrum without group labels)
  retains only ~(k_τ/m)·σ_b² of it — an **SNR improvement of order
  m/k_τ**, and grouping is consistent whenever Δ² ≳ (k_τ/m)σ_b² + noise.
  Here the conjecture is TRUE and quantified: identity CAN be suppressed
  before grouping, because it lives off the type axes.
- **ALIGNED case** (identity supported IN S — people differ along the
  same axes that distinguish types): projection removes nothing;
  b displaces persons across type boundaries irreducibly, and grouping
  error has a FLOOR ≈ Φ(−Δ/(2σ_{b,u})) per boundary (σ_{b,u} the
  identity sd along the boundary normal). Here the conjecture is FALSE
  in principle: "removing identity" would remove position in trait space
  itself — the types are discretizations of the very continuum identity
  lives on.

**The dichotomy is the honest answer to "can it be proven": the
conjecture is provable exactly when identity is geometrically off-axis
from type structure — and whether it is, in any given world, is an
empirical taxometric fact, not a theorem.** (This is the classical
types-vs-dimensions question — Meehl's taxometrics — restated as a
subspace geometry condition inside IDT.)

**P.4 — Theorem R3 (what "error = 0" asserts, and the completeness
audit). [PROVED as definition-consequence]** The zero-error/typological
assumption asserts b ≡ 0 and s ≡ 0 within types: all members of a type
are exchangeable. IDT makes this FALSIFIABLE with instruments we already
validated: within-type deviations must carry NO frame-refreshed,
occasion-reproducible component (T6″). Hence:

- **Audit criterion:** a typology's *completeness defect* := the
  surviving-identity share of its within-group deviations (measured by
  the T6″ discriminator). Zero ⟺ the typology's own error-free claim
  holds on that population.
- **Impossibility half:** in an identity-bearing world (σ_b > 0), EVERY
  typology has completeness defect ≥ the b-share — typological
  completeness is impossible there, and its failure is a measurable
  number, not a philosophical complaint.
- **Distinction kept:** partition-CORRECTNESS (groups match g) and
  completeness (no surviving identity) are different properties; correct
  partitions still fail the completeness audit whenever b > 0. The
  owner's 誤差=0 hypothesis is thereby converted from an assumption into
  a STOPPING RULE and audit meter for any grouping method.

**P.5 — R4 (the identity tax on grouping — registered for measurement).**
The K-line measured identity content taxing FRAME reading (negative
author share) and person-variance taxing TRAIT reading (κ ≈ 0.72). The
reverse reading predicts the third tax: grouping accuracy (ARI) declines
in identity share at fixed Δ along an R2-geometry curve, with oracle
identity removal restoring it in ISO worlds and NOT in ALIGNED worlds.
This, the audit calibration, and the dichotomy's floor are the M4-L
line's instrument leg (L1), registered before run in
`docs/SUICA_M4_L_TYPOLOGY_LINE_PLAN.md`.

**P.6 — Literature anchors (positioning only, citation pass PENDING).**
Taxometrics and the types-vs-dimensions debate: Meehl 1992, 1995;
personality-type literature (resilient/over-/under-controlled types:
Asendorpf; Specht et al.; Herzberg & Roth); mixture separation and
provable clustering (model-based clustering: Fraley & Raftery; separation
conditions for Gaussian mixtures and spectral methods: Achlioptas &
McSherry, Vempala & Wang); EM/Lloyd fixed-point structure. No specific
claims asserted from memory.

Scope unchanged: EXPLORATORY, synthetic, instrument-world claims only.

## Dated appendix Q (2026-08-10, after M4-L1 — the theory-repair note P2L demands): the floor is projection-invariant; the dichotomy relocates; the conjecture reaches its final sharpened form

M4-L1 held the ordinal geometry perfectly (the 10-cell predicted ordering
reproduced cell for cell; the ρ.35 floor contained; the tax ratio 8.15×)
and failed two shadows. Both failures are now understood, and one is a
theorem.

**Q.1 — Floor-invariance lemma. [PROVED]** For any boundary normal
u ∈ S, projection onto S leaves the identity component along u unchanged:
⟨P_S b, u⟩ = ⟨b, u⟩. Hence **no projection can reduce Bayes assignment
error — in ANY geometry.** Measured shadow: oracle-S projection restored
13.5% [−2.6, 27.7] of the ISO deficit at ρ.55 and 15.0% at ρ.75 — flat,
exactly as the lemma demands; the small restoration is centroid-noise
reduction, not floor change.

**Q.2 — The dichotomy relocates.** ISO and ALIGNED differ by the
boundary-normal variance ratio σ²_{u,ALIGNED}/σ²_{u,ISO} = m/k_τ
(z-ratio √(m/k_τ) = 4 at 48/3 — matching L1's Δ-free boundary algebra;
measured ARI-drop ratio 8.145911689523754 at matched identity energy).
**P.3's m/k_τ factor is real; it lives in the FLOOR RATIO between
geometries, not in what projection can buy.**

**Q.3 — R2's ISO half, restated.** Projection's genuine purchase is
centroid LOCALIZATION: below the consistency threshold — where ambient
clustering cannot find the structure at all — the (k_τ/m)-fold energy
reduction lets spiked-PCA + clustering still find it. Above threshold it
buys ~nothing (Q.1). P.3's energy algebra was correct arithmetic attached
to the wrong observable (defect #30 → standing rule 19). The restated
claim is testable only in the ambient-failure regime: M4-L2's W-1.

**Q.4 — The owner's conjecture, final sharpened form.** TRUE identity
removal works trivially (measured: ARI → 0.9948 in both geometries) but
requires knowing b — the R1 circularity. The only label-free surrogate,
projection, provably cannot touch the boundary-normal component (Q.1).
Therefore: **the practical content of "remove identity, then group" is
exactly the removal-vs-projection gap, and that gap IS the
boundary-normal identity variance — unremovable without labels.** Above
the localization threshold, grouping error is floor-bound by the
geometry (η) alone; below it, projection buys localization. What remains
label-free buyable: localization, and the noise/state suppressions
(averaging, frame refreshment) that were never the hard part.

**Q.5 — The audit needed one constant, not a new theory.** L1's V-4 miss
is a single diagnosed calibration constant (B̂ = 0.245861 vs 0.25;
(0.25−B̂)·c_cont = +0.002754 reproduces the offset; ALIGNED cells failed
tracking because their CIs are 1.5–2.4× tighter, not because their bias
is larger). R3 stands; the calibrated cross-fitted meter is L2's W-4.

**Q.6 — Method.** Defects #27–#30 recorded; standing rules 18 (JOINT
satisfiability across knob-sharing clauses) and 19 (every lean bar
shadows the theorem's OWN quantity, stated in a fidelity table) created.

## Dated appendix R (2026-08-10, after M4-L2): the floor curve is measured; the localization window lemma; Q.5 refuted

**R.1 — The η-continuum floor law is MEASURED.** σ_u²(η) = η·σ_b²/k_τ +
(1−η)·σ_b²/m: containment 7/10 at the bar with EXACT η-ordering at both
identity energies (the two void cells are below the run's resolution
quantum — a fact about the grid, not the law). The projection-invariant
floor is now the L-line's central certified object.

**R.2 — The localization window lemma (replacing P2M's registered
reading).** L2's W-1 missed on a window the registration itself made
empty (defect #31, proved pre-arms by the rule-18 joint check): at these
dims, {oracle-S > .8} ≡ {Bayes ceiling > .8}, because the ceiling is set
by the SLOW-STATE channel (2.3× the identity's boundary-normal variance)
and is Δ-free — so no Δ has ambient failing while projection cleanly
succeeds. The MECHANISM is real and measured: the localization gap is
+0.2571 [+0.2409, +0.2769] at the hardest rung (4.28×), declining
monotonically to ~0 where ambient succeeds, with oracle-S ON the ceiling
throughout the hard rungs. **Lemma (stated; width law conjectured at
(d/n)^¼):** the qualitative window [Δ*_ambient, Δ*_Bayes] in which
"ambient fails but projected succeeds" exists only when the ambient
break point lies below the state-set Bayes shoulder; its width is
dimension- and noise-governed and CAN BE EMPTY, as here. R2-ISO's final
status: the floor ratio (proved + measured, 8.15×) plus a continuous,
measured, Δ-declining localization gap — and no guaranteed qualitative
regime. Projection claims end here.

**R.3 — Q.5 is REFUTED, on the record.** Calibrating B̂ made tracking
WORSE (2/10 vs the uncalibrated 5/10); the same calibrated meter on TRUE
groups tracks 10/10; cross-fitting cost the two-split contrast a 2.154×
conditioning loss. The audit's residual error is PARTITION-borne. The
completeness meter is certified ON TRUE/GIVEN PARTITIONS ONLY; the
estimated-partition form requires the propagation instrument (M4-L3's
X-3), and if that fails it is retired, not patched again. The same-data
optimistic bias itself is confirmed (pooled −0.005767 [−0.006439,
−0.005165], 10/10 — L2-charter Derivation 4's sign, clean).

**R.4 — Method.** Defects #31–#35; standing rule 20 (an empty joint
condition-set STOPS the leg pre-arms — rule 10's analogue at the
adjudication layer). W-2's estimated-S ARI claim withdrawn at these dims
(the BBP overlap approaches prediction, 30.1% → 0.5% shortfall with Δ;
the bar was on the wrong quantity — defect #33, rule-19 class).

## Dated appendix S (2026-08-10, after M4-L3 — the M4-L line closes): the reverse question, answered

The owner asked: *does assuming error = 0 assert "no identity" — and
conversely, would REMOVING identity make correct personality grouping
possible? Can this be proven?* After three legs (L1–L3) on top of the
P/Q/R theory, the answer in six measured or proved pieces:

1. **In the error-free world, grouping works** — measured: ARI 0.9948
   at zero identity share, both geometries. The hypothesis's premise
   world behaves as it claims.
2. **True identity removal restores grouping completely** — measured:
   ARI → 0.9948 in both geometries. But true removal requires knowing
   b, which requires the groups: the circularity is R1's theorem, and
   its resolution is EM (the proposal, formalized, IS the E-step).
3. **No label-free surrogate can buy what matters above threshold** —
   the floor-invariance lemma (Q.1, proved; measured flat at
   13.5%/15.0% restoration). What projection CAN buy is localization —
   real, measured at 4.28× on the hardest rung — but its qualitative
   window is dimension-governed and CAN BE EMPTY (the window lemma,
   R.2; empty at these dims).
4. **The true governing quantity is the geometry**: the
   projection-invariant floor curve σ_u²(η) = η·σ_b²/k_τ +
   (1−η)·σ_b²/m — measured three times independently (L1 poles, L2
   curve, L3 fresh-seed reproduction; η-ordering exact every time),
   with the between-geometry tax ratio m/k_τ (z-ratio 4; ARI-drop
   ratio 8.15× at matched energy).
5. **Whether the conjecture applies to a given world is READABLE,
   label-free**: the taxometer η̂ is certified at ±0.125 (10/10 cells,
   median error 0.024, ordering exact under every reading), with a
   known +O(0.05) pole bias and the whitening-shape precondition. The
   types-vs-dimensions question is, in this family, an instrument
   reading, not a debate.
6. **"Error = 0" is now an audit, with a certified meter**: the
   completeness meter (surviving-identity share) is calibrated on true
   partitions, carries the partition-propagation correction
   (deviation ~ (1−ARI), R² 0.89, slope −0.047), and has a measured
   noise floor of ~0.005 absolute — the per-world constant fluctuates
   at the same scale as anything smaller. Typology's zero-error claim
   is testable to that precision, and in identity-bearing worlds it
   fails by exactly the identity share (the impossibility half of R3).

**The one-paragraph answer to the owner:** removing identity DOES make
correct grouping possible — under three conditions now proved or
measured: the removal must be TRUE removal (which requires the groups,
so the two are solved jointly as EM fixed points); the geometry must
permit it (the aligned fraction η sets a floor that no label-free
operation touches); and the geometry itself can be read in advance with
the certified taxometer. And "assuming error = 0" is exactly the
assertion b ≡ 0 — no longer a modeling convenience but a testable claim
with a calibrated meter, precise to ±0.005, beyond which the world's
own per-batch fluctuation takes over. The old hypothesis was not wrong;
it was an audit criterion waiting for its instrument.

**Method.** Defects #36–#38; standing rule 21 (precision budgets on
containment bars). Line synthesis:
`docs/SUICA_M4_L_TYPOLOGY_LINE_SYNTHESIS.md`. Scope as always:
EXPLORATORY, synthetic, instrument-world claims; nothing here licenses
claims about persons.

## Dated appendix T (2026-08-10, after D2): the headline table is adversarially verified; corrections and the fragility annex

**D2 (defense phase) re-derived the 10-row headline table from raw
per-cell artifacts, refute-tasked and independent: 7 CONFIRMED, 3
QUALIFIED, 0 REFUTED, 0 UNVERIFIABLE.** The table stands. The QUALIFIED
rows are wording debts of this document and the syntheses, corrected
here by dated note (defect #40, four instances, planner's prose):

1. Appendix C.1: read "0 flips out of 31,520" as reader-A over the
   FOUR non-oracle norm arms (five arms would be 39,400); reader B's
   5,473 flips violate T3(c)'s hypothesis by construction, as the K1
   report disclosed.
2. Appendix C.2: the free-design inertness bound is ≤ 0.00452 (true
   max 0.004512746557818383), not "≤ 0.0045".
3. K-R1 (appendix N and the K synthesis): the true quantifier is
   stronger — 0 positive of 192 arm-world deltas.
4. The L synthesis's "three independent confirmations" of the floor
   law reads honestly as: two independent curve confirmations (L2 and
   L3, each 7/10 containment with EXACT η-ordering; L3's misses at
   3.6e-14 / 2.2e-04 / 3.3e-07) plus L1's pole anchors, one of which
   is a designed identity. Appendix S item 5's "under every reading"
   scopes to the ten per-arm slices (Spearman 1.0 in 10/10); the
   cross-arm pooled Spearman is 0.985.

One artifact note: K1's persisted L3 slope differs from the
exact-rational OLS of its own CSV by 1.18e-13 — sub-display-precision,
containment unaffected, recorded.

**Fragility annex (adopted; binds the D1 seal's opening
expectations):** q is three numbers across legs (1.8327 / 1.8529 /
1.9338; 19-arm R² 0.868) — cite it as a band, not a constant; κ's
R² 0.9935 rests on six leveraged pairs (9-pair refit −0.7146); γ moves
±0.01 under weight-scheme choice; the K3 rotation bound consumed 99.8%
of its own headroom; de-framed λ = 0.0008 is a boundary value on an
unidentified power law. None of these re-scores a lean; all of them
constrain how the numbers may be QUOTED and how the sealed predictions
must be judged at opening.

## Dated appendix U (2026-08-10, after D-open): the seal opened — two laws promoted to PREDICTIVE, one conjecture dead, one formula scoped

D-open measured the five sealed configurations FIRST (ordering enforced
in code: 86.7 s gap, zero pre-stamp bundle reads), unsealed second
(hash MATCH), scored with no re-fitting: **3 PREDICTED / 2 MISSED**.

**U.1 — Promotions.** The **η-floor law** predicted per-boundary rates
at dims it had never seen (m=96, k_τ=4, G=5; 3/3 inside its sealed
bands) — it is henceforth cited as a PREDICTIVE law, the program's
strongest single object. The **taxometer** read a novel cell (η=0.6,
new energy) with error 0.0042 against its ±0.125 certificate. The tax
ratio's exact algebra held to 8.9e-16 with strict ordering.

**U.2 — The (d/n)^¼ window-width conjecture is DEAD.** At (192,256)
the sealed OPEN interval (width +0.299) measured EMPTY (−0.285). The
window LEMMA stands (R.2). Caveats on the record: empty by one grid
rung (~2.85 SEM); the interp second reading disagrees and was
pre-empted by the pinned grid reading. New clarification, to prevent
misreading of R.2: the Bayes-shoulder/oracle-S edge is Δ-invariant AT
FIXED DIMS (that is what Q.1 proves); D-open measured it MOVING −7.25%
ACROSS dims. Dimension-dependence of the shoulder is real and was
never excluded by the lemma.

**U.3 — The T4 composite's LEVEL form is scoped out.** The sealed
formula field ≈ λ·r^q − κ·V_person missed its new arm by 5.09
band-widths — and the diagnosis exonerates the world (the measured
value interpolates its neighbors exactly) and convicts the GLUE: κ was
fitted on within-pair differences, λ·r^q on a pooled curve (R² 0.868),
and their sum was never a level law — it under-predicts even its own
training arms by −0.060..−0.126. **T4's closure claims stand unchanged
(reader-borne; quadratic over-response; the variance tax on
DIFFERENCES at R² 0.9935; the fragile species surcharge). What is
withdrawn, by this dated note, is the composite's use as an ABSOLUTE
LEVEL formula.** The level question is registered as M4-K2f.

**U.4 — Machinery note (RN-DO-8).** A latent defect in l1/l2's
`type_geometry` (uninitialized labels when G∤n) was found by Part-0
realizability checking; it never bit any published number (all L-legs
at 512 % 4 == 0); the n % G == 0 refusal is now a convention.

## Dated appendix V (2026-08-10, after M4-K2f): the level law, restored and scoped — the tax was never the error

K2f compiled all 26 persisted level observations (bit-exact
provenance), fit three pre-declared candidate forms, selected by
leave-one-out, then PREDICTED a fresh arm before running it (ordering
enforced in code) — and the prediction landed at 25.3% of its band's
half-width. **LEVEL_LAW_RESTORED**, in the form this corpus can
license:

    field ≈ λ′ − κ′·V_person      (λ′ ≈ 0.180 [0.163, 0.201];
                                    κ′ ≈ 0.750 [0.520, 0.861])

**V.1 — The tax is the level law's whole content here.** κ′ lands at
0.72–0.75 in ALL three candidate forms — statistically the same number
as the difference-fitted 0.722 and the 9-pair refit 0.715. Three
independent fitting routes, one constant. What D-open killed was the
GLUE (λ·r^q as a level term); what survives every test is the tax.

**V.2 — The exponent is not extractable at level from this corpus.**
q′ CIs straddle zero in every form because r and V_person are collinear
at −0.964 BY DESIGN (the matched-pair legs made them so). The quadratic
over-response (q ≈ 1.83–1.93) remains a RESPONSE-structure fact,
measured where it lives (K2b's swings). The r-at-level question needs a
decollinearized corpus — named, not queued.

**V.3 — Grade.** Interpolation-grade: the fresh arm sat between
training shares; extrapolation is unsealed. The named follow-up (not
queued) is a D1-style seal of the new form at an extrapolated share.

**V.4 — Method.** Rule 24's largest single catch to date: 14 wrong
hand-typed cells in the leg's own report table, found by mechanical
re-read before commit — report tables carrying artifact numbers are
henceforth GENERATED, never typed. The leg's 19-second budget overrun
was MEASURED and disclosed (the honest mirror of D5's E-1). Zero
planner registration defects — the third consecutive clean
registration.

## Appendix W — dated append (2026-08-11): the registered family's span gap, and pre-outcome readings of M1's cells (planner derivation)

Status: derived AFTER M4-M1's registration was committed (140e927) and
the executor dispatched, BEFORE any M1 world output exists or has been
read. Nothing here alters M1's leans, gates or routing — it sharpens
the MECHANISM reading each pre-registered cell will carry. Committed
mid-run precisely so the dating is verifiable.

**W.1 — The span gap.** All four registered forms place their additive
constant at ≤ 0 relative to the power term (F1 none; F1e −ε with
ε ≥ 0, T4's own species floor; F2/F3 none). The structure "positive
floor plus positive power", c + λ·r^q with c > 0, λ > 0, is OUTSIDE
the family's span. If the truth has that shape, the family's best
reachable account is a single flattened power — expect winner F1 (or
F2) with fractional q̂ ∈ (0, 1) and a U-shaped residual-in-r signature
within share strata (the single power carries less curvature than the
floor-lifted curve; residuals positive at both r-extremes, negative
mid-range). Discriminator, stated before the data: that U-shape maps
to a NON-monotone residual-in-φ pattern within shares, so the L-4
Spearman probe stays quiet while a quadratic-in-r residual coefficient
fires. An L-4 monotone fire is φ-leak evidence; a quadratic fire with
quiet Spearman is FORM-GAP evidence, and the follow-up is a registered
form extension (M1b or M2's alternative), not a φ-channel claim.

**W.2 — What each cell means mechanically.**
- Cell 2 (R_TERM_ABSENT_AT_LEVEL): the reader's level output in this
  regime is floor-dominated; the square-law lives strictly in
  perturbations (K2b's swings). The level constant λ′ then reads as
  FRAME-owned content (K1's amplification finding supplies the owner),
  predicting the floor should move under issuer-error manipulation — a
  T9-flavored probe, named only, not queued.
- Cell 4 (LEVEL_RESPONSE_DISSOCIATION) with q̂ ∈ (0, 1): ambiguous
  between a genuine shallow power and W.1's span-gap signature; the
  quadratic-residual discriminator adjudicates the reading (not the
  cell).
- Cell 5 (SINGLE_EXPONENT_RESTORED): K2f's flat picture was purely the
  collinearity artifact. The sealed S-4 miss then needs re-explaining:
  if level truly follows r^1.85, the 26/26 under-prediction indicts
  the AMPLITUDE, not the exponent — the sealed λ was a response-fit
  constant that does not transfer to level. Sub-case name:
  AMPLITUDE_RESCALING (exponent transfers, amplitude refits).
- Cell 3 (NON_IDENTIFIED_UNDERPOWERED) should be nearly unreachable
  unless λ is genuinely small — see W.3 — which is why reaching it
  would itself be informative about λ.

**W.3 — Decisiveness arithmetic (design-level, superseded by G3m-b's
simulation once the pilot σ_w exists).** Per-cell SEM projects to
~0.005 at 32 worlds (K2F-FRESH: CI half-width 0.0097 → SEM ≈ 0.0050).
Over M1's estimated realized r-range [~0.46, ~0.84] (G1m's arithmetic
table controls), the r-term spread at λ ≈ 0.18 is ≈ 0.088 at q = 1.85
(~17 SEM), ≈ 0.068 at q = 1 (~14 SEM), ≈ 0.043 at q = 0.5 (~9 SEM),
≈ 0.020 at q = 0.2 (~4 SEM). Any real r-dependence down to q ~ 0.2 is
multiple noise floors wide; flatness, if found, will be flatness of
the world, not of the design.

## Appendix X — dated append (2026-08-11): the level exponent is negative; the response-grade band is re-attributed; the coordinate question is opened (M4-M1c)

**X.1 — The measurement.** On the first decollinearized corpus (M1c:
share × φ factorial, 20 cells × 192 worlds, within-share sweeps at
EXACTLY fixed V), the level law's exponent is identified at the first
attempt: winner form q = −0.15040108849226472 [−0.18322395953281184,
−0.11871900002844447] (width 0.065 against a 0.60 bar); the unbounded
companion agrees (−0.189 [−0.227, −0.149]). At fixed V = 0.18, r
falls 0.657 → 0.454 while the measured field RISES 0.0541 → 0.0638 =
4.03 pooled SEM. **The level law's r-dependence is negative — small,
real, and opposite in sign to the response-grade exponent.**

**X.2 — The re-attribution (dated correction to appendix V.2's
split).** V.2 kept "the quadratic over-response (q ≈ 1.83–1.93)" as a
response-structure fact "measured where it lives (K2b's swings)."
The M-line's audit trail now shows: K2b's sweeps are SHARE-driven, so
r and V move in lockstep there — **no V-clean positive-exponent
measurement exists anywhere in the record**, and the first V-clean
measurement (M1c) is negative. The band q = 1.83 [1.71, 1.98] remains
a true description of the pooled share-driven curve; its ATTRIBUTION
to a readability exponent does not survive. Plainly: **the "quadratic
over-response" was mostly the variance tax wearing r's clothes.**
Yield clause: if a V-clean positive-exponent measurement is found or
produced on this instrument family, this note yields to it. (M1d
carries the in-corpus demonstration: the V-omitted shadow fit,
pre-signed positive.)

**X.3 — The tax's fourth appearance.** κ = 0.7601952008701406
[0.7356727662590873, 0.7846243216827854], against 0.7220359963712748
(difference-fitted, sealed), ≈0.715 (9-pair refit), 0.750086268225045
(K2f level refit). Four routes — difference-space, matched pairs,
collinear level, decollinearized level — one constant. The tax, not
the exponent, is the reader's invariant; M3's one-κ question now has
four points and a fifth is pre-registered in M1d (L-3d).

**X.4 — The coordinate question (named, M1d charters).** The sign
makes a mechanism hypothesis testable: the deployed gauge may be an
OCCASION-STRUCTURE consumer, not a card consumer — slower state
(higher φ) yields more coherent occasion blocks and a more readable
person×frame interaction (K-R1's scaffold; K2b's G4b), raising the
field even as the card attenuates. If so, the level law's second
argument is φ (state dynamics), not r (card readability), and T4's
composite was written in the wrong coordinate. The factorial can
discriminate (within share they are re-parametrizations; across
shares they part), and M1d fits both representations head-to-head.

**X.5 — Appendix W post-mortem (rule 24 applied to the planner's own
prediction).** W.1's discriminator FIRED IN KIND — within-share
quadratic residual with the Spearman probe quiet, form-gap not
φ-leak — but with INVERTED SIGN: W.1 predicted a positive-U for the
(c>0, q>0) corner; the world sits at (c pressed to its bound, q<0)
and the measured r² coefficient is −0.199 [−0.288, −0.107]. The
prediction was wrong in sign; the prescription (a registered form
extension) was right and is executed as M1d. Recorded plainly so the
record shows the planner's derivation corrected by measurement.

**X.6 — Instrument lesson → rule 26.** The winning form's ε sat ON
its declared bound (within 9.04e-14), making its CI
one-sided-by-construction; the verdicts survived only because the
5%-tie rule forced agreement with the unbounded form. Rule 26 (M-line
plan doc) makes that co-adjudication mandatory wherever a bound is
active, and types bound-activity as a finding.

## Appendix Y — dated append (2026-08-11, post-M1d): the exponent dissolves into a slope; the shape question replaces the coordinate question

**Y.1 — Correction to X.1's exponent line (the dissociation verdict
stands).** With the constant freed (M1d's F0), the triple (c, λ, q)
rides a ridge — q [0.021913588793404413, 2.6445200496694605], λ
entirely negative, c wide — and (λ<0, q>0, c>0) describes the same
falling-in-r field M1c's intercept-free form described as (λ>0,
q<0). **"q = −0.150" is withdrawn as a structural parameter value**:
it was the intercept-free family's only way to express a falling
curve. What is parameterisation-free and stands: **∂field/∂r < 0 at
fixed V** (model-free 4.03-SEM contrast; every fitted
parameterisation agrees in slope sign), and with it the
LEVEL–RESPONSE DISSOCIATION (a sign statement, not an exponent
statement). The r-window [0.454, 0.819] cannot pin power-law
curvature once a constant is honest — a measured limit, not a
failure.

**Y.2 — The re-attribution now has its one-number proof.** Fitting
field = λ·r^q with the tax OMITTED on M1c's own decollinearized cells
gives q_shadow = 2.24488769944643 [2.1768337883424214,
2.318980336007031] — the exponent snaps from negative-slope to
above-the-response-band positive the moment V is dropped. X.2's
claim ("the quadratic over-response was mostly the variance tax
wearing r's clothes") is thereby demonstrated inside a single corpus.

**Y.3 — The structure is cross-corpus.** With NO refit, every M1d
form retrodicts K2f's 26 legacy rows at RMSE 0.0056–0.0064 — 18.9×
better than the sealed composite, and at K2f's own refit-LOO level.
The constant-minus-tax-with-weak-negative-slope structure is a
property of the instrument family, not of one corpus.

**Y.4 — The coordinate question, refined.** The naive state-dynamics
representation (c + a·φ^m − κ·V) LOST to the r-mediated intercept
form even cross-share — X.4's simple mechanism form is not
supported. But the within-share concavity persists under every
registered form (r² −0.126 [−0.177, −0.072] after the intercept), so
the true refinement is the SHAPE question: does field(share, φ)
separate additively into a tax margin plus a φ margin (which kills
r-mediation, since r is strongly non-additive in share × φ), or does
r carry the cross-structure? M1e decides on the persisted corpus.

**Y.5 — The tax, five routes.** κ = 0.715 / 0.722 / 0.750 / 0.760 /
0.777 (difference-fit, 9-pair refit, K2f level, M1c, M1d) —
chainwise-overlapping CIs with a mild upward drift in level-space
routes, recorded unadjudicated as the one-κ question's opening
observation (M3).

**Y.6 — Method.** Rule 26 fired automatically on its first
opportunity (F1e's active ε bound → F1 co-adjudication). Rule 27
(identification budgets on any consumed object) was bought by defect
#45: M1d's own routing would have sealed a ridge had the residual
come back quiet. Selection is not identification; consumption
requires both.

## Appendix Z — dated append (2026-08-11, post-M1e): the readability penalty; κ becomes representation-indexed

**Z.1 — The level law's measured shape (corpus-scoped).** The field
does not separate additively in (share, φ): the winning form is
field = α(share) − |λ|·r^q with λ = −0.057625974791364554
[−0.0843564122153383, −0.042724477794351616] (identified) and q steep
(point 3.86, CI [2.05, 5.92] — NOT identified; rule 27 blocked its
consumption). Propagating (λ, q) through each share's φ-extremes
reproduces the model-free contrast table including its non-monotone
hump (planner arithmetic, M1e adjudication) — the shape is real even
where the exponent is loose. Because the power is steep, the level
price concentrates where cards are MOST readable (high r): named the
**readability penalty** — at fixed person share, worlds whose cards
read best pay the largest level deduction under the deployed gauge.
Mechanism open; the additive state-dynamics alternative lost
head-to-head, twice.

**Z.2 — κ is representation-indexed.** Within any single
representation the tax coefficient is sharply identified; across
representations it moves: 0.6761549415814 [0.662, 0.690] under
tax-forced-additive margins (a REJECTED model, +32% LOO — comparison
typed representation-conditioned under rule 28) against 0.72–0.78 in
the subtractive-V families, with the free share-margins sitting
CONVEX below their linear-in-V chord by ~2–3 cell-SEMs. The one-κ
question (M3) is refined accordingly: in which representation class
is the tax an invariant, and is the V-margin linear at all. The
five-route table of appendix Y.5 carries this as its standing caveat.

**Z.3 — Method.** Rule 27's first firing blocked the seal of a
3.87×-over-budget exponent while the rejected model met every budget
— selection and identification are different licenses, now
demonstrated rather than asserted. Rules 15/16 were violated by an
overlapping routing table (#46, planner's); rule 28 was enacted
(#48). The seal (M2) proceeds on PREDICTIONS in the trained
r-window, where the parameter ridge does not live.

## Appendix AA — dated append (2026-08-11, post-M2): the level law reaches PREDICTIVE-SCOPED; the domain principle; the tax-curve hypothesis

**AA.1 — The promotion.** The scoped level law — free share-margins
plus the steep negative r-power (the readability penalty), realized r
interior to [0.4541409476972356, 0.8189581462487876] — survived a
prospective hash-sealed test at three configurations OUTSIDE its
training: a share-exterior contrast (share 0.70 > the 0.6634 envelope
top), an interior-new-φ level (φ 0.45), and a φ-exterior contrast
(φ 0.995). 3/3 inside pre-declared bands (positions +0.867 / −0.238 /
−0.368 of half-width; zero pre-stamp world generations; salt embedded
in the sealed bytes). Grade: **PREDICTIVE-SCOPED — sealed-then-hit,
with the scope (predictions in the trained r-window, not parameters)
as part of the claim.** The parameter ridge (appendix Y.1) is
untouched: q remains unquotable; what predicts is the law's
prediction-space restriction.

**AA.2 — The domain principle (instrument lesson, rule 29).** M2
turned on one word: a pilot world at −0.0008 fails a strictly-
positive sanity check and ends the leg UNRESOLVED, or passes the
registered "non-saturated" test and lets the seal be measured. The
statistic's own domain decides: recovery_b_only is a weighted mean of
matrix cosines on [−1, 1] — zero is its NULL, not its floor — and at
the most-taxed cell ever run (V = 0.21, mean 0.0344, world-sd
0.0186), the expected minimum over 192 draws is ≈ −0.016: negative
worlds are predicted by the hypothesis being tested. **A sanity gate
that does not know the statistic's null from its floor gates on the
hypothesis.** Rule 29 makes the domain-pinned predicate mandatory;
the retroactive scan of prior legs' (0,1)-style checks is assigned
to M3's G0.

**AA.3 — The tax-curve hypothesis (pre-M3 planner derivation, on the
record before the leg runs).** The local tax κ(V) = −dα/dV, from
M1e's free margins and M2's exterior cells:
0.8879774845146051 (V .03→.075), 0.8066738116034938 (.075→.12),
0.7112187983417673 (.12→.18), [~0.62, ~0.81] (.18→.21) — a monotone
decline. Three independent signs now point the same way: the free
margins sit convex below their chord (M1e); the tax-linear stress
prediction under-shot the V = 0.21 level in its pre-signed direction
(M2, STRESS_ABOVE); and the slope table itself. If κ is a curve,
"one κ" was an artifact of averaging over each design's V-support —
and the representation spread becomes PREDICTABLE: a representation
omitting the r-channel loads cov(−|λ|·r^q, V) > 0 into its slope and
must read LOW (pre-signed for M1e's 0.676 before M3 runs). M3's
closure test asks one law to retrodict all six published κ̂ values
through each estimator's own pipeline; hits and misses both teach.

**AA.4 — What the M-line has settled so far, in one paragraph.** At
level, on this instrument family: the field is a falling function of
V (the tax — five sharply-identified within-representation
appearances, now hypothesized a curve); plus a small steep NEGATIVE
r-channel concentrated where cards read best (the readability
penalty, sealed in its scoped form); the response-grade positive
exponent was the tax's shadow through collinear designs (V-shadow
demonstration q = +2.245); additive state-dynamics representations
lose head-to-head; and the whole structure transfers across corpora
without refitting (18.9× over the sealed composite on K2f's 26
rows). What remains open, named: the within-share concavity's owner
(form family incomplete), q's value (unquotable by rule 27), the
tax curve's verdict (M3), and every real-text question (governance
R-G1..R-G8 untouched).

## Appendix BB — dated append (2026-08-11, post-M3): the tax is a curve; the constant-κ era closes; the M-line closes

**BB.1 — The curve.** On the decollinearized instrument family, the
level share-margin is quadratic in person-variance: α(V) = c − κ0·V +
(κ2/2)·V², c = 0.21247398265278816 [0.209, 0.216], κ0 =
0.9601680204204508 [0.894, 1.031], κ2 = 1.562877770472943 [1.032,
2.120] (B = 20000 stable; all rule-27 budgets met; projection powers
0.9935 / 0.0575). The LOCAL tax κ(V) = κ0 − κ2·V declines 0.913 →
0.632 over V ∈ [0.03, 0.21]. Both pre-run planner values (appendix
AA.3: 0.983, 1.815) landed inside the fresh intervals. Scope: the
A-quad/A-sat tie (3.2%) leaves the FORM unsettled beyond V = 0.21;
A-quad's zero at V ≈ 0.614 is out-of-scope arithmetic, not a
prediction.

**BB.2 — Five routes were one law.** The published κ̂ values were
never in conflict: run through each estimator's OWN pipeline, the
single law (curve + fixed channel) retrodicts 0.722 → 0.746, 0.750 →
0.768, 0.760 → 0.763, 0.777 → 0.781, and — in the pre-signed LOW
direction, via the channel-covariance loading — 0.676 → 0.680; the
one miss is the 9-pair refit (0.715 → 0.749, 0.0045 over its 0.03
point-tolerance, the only target without a persisted CI). "One κ"
was an artifact of averaging; the SPREAD was the information.

**BB.3 — T4 at level, final scoped statement.** field(share, φ) =
c − κ0·V + (κ2/2)·V² + λ·r^q, with λ = −0.0576 [−0.084, −0.043]
identified, q unquotable (rule 27), predictions PREDICTIVE-SCOPED
(M2's 3/3 seal, r interior), the curve interpolative in V and
closure-validated. The card ≠ biography theorem now has its level
form with every term's epistemic grade attached — which is what
"closed" means in this program.

**BB.4 — The first marginal-price statement in IDT.** κ(V) declining
means the reader's MARGINAL tax per unit person-variance falls as
person-variance rises — diminishing marginal taxation. The five
sharply-identified within-representation κ's were secants of one
curve. Why QUADRATIC is not settled here: appendix CC derives the
square-agreement mechanism whose reparametrization it is, and the
M4-N line seals that mechanism's response-transport prediction
before believing it.

**BB.5 — Line-close bookkeeping.** Seven legs, seven
registrations-before-run, zero amends, zero agent pushes; rules
25–29 enacted, defects #43–#49 recorded (M3: zero); synthesis at
`docs/SUICA_M4_M_LEVEL_LAW_LINE_SYNTHESIS.md`; graded-laws table
updated by dated addendum in `docs/SUICA_V8_IDT_INTEGRATION.md`.

## Appendix CC — dated append (2026-08-11): the square-agreement mechanism (planner derivation, BEFORE the M4-N line runs)

**CC.1 — The observation.** A-quad is EXACTLY the reparametrization
of a shifted square: α(V) = c′ + A0·(1 − V/V*)², with V* = κ0/κ2,
A0 = κ0²/(2κ2), c′ = c − A0. At M3's central values: V* =
0.6143507762088093, A0 = 0.29489267237567145, c′ =
−0.08241868972288329. Mechanism candidate: the gauge's b-only
agreement degrades as the SQUARE of person-variance contamination —
one more square law from a reader already convicted of quadratic
loss (K1's attenuation square; K2b's over-response), which is what
makes this derivation plausible rather than numerological.

**CC.2 — What is testable and what is not.** On-support (V ≤ 0.21,
and this generator caps V = 0.3·share ≤ 0.3), the square form is
observationally identical to A-quad — the vertex V* ≈ 0.614 is
UNREACHABLE arithmetic. The mechanism's real content is TRANSPORT:
because differences at matched r cancel the channel and the margins
exactly, a matched-attenuation pair straddling base-variance V̄ must
measure κ_resp(V̄) = κ0 − κ2·V̄ — EXACTLY, under A-quad, with no
approximation. Fresh response-grade experiments at new V̄ therefore
test the curve OUTSIDE the level-fit's estimation space: κ_resp
(0.0525) = 0.8781, κ_resp(0.1875) = 0.6671, and the DECLINE between
them 0.2110 — three sealable numbers. That is M4-N1.

**CC.3 — Pre-registered honesty.** If N1 misses, the curve is
level-only (a fitting fact, not a mechanism) and CC.1 dies as
physics while BB.1 stands as measurement. If N1 hits, the square
mechanism earns its next test (the frame-floor question: is c′ the
frame-carried baseline? — named, not queued), and the sealed
difference-fit 0.722 acquires its final reading: a secant of the
curve at its design's V̄.

## Appendix CC.1′ — dated correction (2026-08-11, post-N1): the square-form identities, at executed provenance

N1's G0 caught appendix CC.1's constants failing bit-exact
recomputation from M3's persisted fit — the planner had published
hand-derived digits at 16-digit precision (defect #50; rule 30 now
requires executed provenance for every published derived constant).
Corrected, computed by the N1 harness from the persisted θ:

    V* = κ0/κ2      = 0.6143589975880801
    A0 = κ0²/(2κ2)  = 0.2949439312708197
    c′ = c − A0     = −0.08246994861803153

CC.1's argument is unchanged (the errors were 8.2e-6 / 5.1e-5 /
5.1e-5 — far below any inference drawn from them); CC.2's transport
predictions are functions of (κ0, κ2) directly and reproduce
bit-exactly (0.8781169374706213 / 0.6671284384567739 /
0.21098849901384734). N2's frame-floor question inherits the
corrected c′. The episode itself is the appendix's best footnote:
a program whose gates catch its planner inventing digits is working.

## Appendix DD — dated append (2026-08-14, post-N1b): the tax curve transports; the constant tax is dead in both spaces

**DD.1 — The transport.** The curve fitted at LEVEL (M3) predicted
RESPONSE-grade measurements it never consumed: two fresh
matched-attenuation pairs read κ̂ = 0.9180647112012158 /
0.6670454850877494 against sealed 0.8781169374706213 /
0.6671284384567739 — the high-V̄ pair exact to 8.3e-5 — and the
decline Δκ̂ = 0.2510192261134664 with CI excluding zero, inside its
sealed band. 3/3, hash before any world, zero pre-stamp
generations. **The tax curve is PREDICTIVE (response-transport)
within V ∈ [0.03, 0.21].** The sealed 0.722 difference-fit's final
reading: a secant of this curve near V̄ ≈ 0.15 (approximate, two
digits). The constant tax is dead by sealed measurement at level
(M3) and response (N1b).

**DD.2 — The mechanism's status.** Square-agreement (CC.1′) is a
CANDIDATE with one sealed transport hit. It dies next by: a
transport miss at fresh V̄; the low-V residual direction hardening
into a measured micro-discrepancy (N4's H-c); or a frame-floor
anchor for c′ that mismatches (N2 — registrable only after a
planner derivation establishes what c′ SHOULD equal in-support; if
no in-support anchor exists, N2 dissolves and says so).

**DD.3 — What this experiment cannot tell.** A-quad and A-sat are
empirical twins here (A-sat's co-predictions sat inside A-quad's
bands at all three quantities, agreeing with their M3 tie); the
extrapolant question is open and its feasible-separation arithmetic
will be EXECUTED at N-line synthesis (rule 30) rather than asserted.
The single structured residual — the low-V̄ pair reading +1.31 SE_κ
steeper than the curve — is noise-compatible and recorded as a
direction, not a finding.

**DD.4 — Scorekeeping.** The tax now holds: five within-
representation identifications (secants), a quadratic level law
(M3, consumable), a 5/6 closure through alien pipelines (M3), and a
sealed response transport (N1b). What remains against it: one
closure miss under forensic (N4), one noise-compatible residual,
and every question outside V ∈ [0.03, 0.21].
