# SUICA M4-C.3.5-R2B Conditional Response-Safe Chart Protocol

## Status

This protocol is frozen before any R2B confirmation response or oracle
endpoint is opened. R2B is a new estimand. The two R2 development repetitions
are design evidence only and are excluded from every confirmation interval.

The original R2 universal-replacement proposition is closed as
`M4_C35_R2_PARTIAL_CHART_EFFECT`: its `world_consistency` gate failed because
the selection-creation compensation sentinel had mean `R-B0 = -0.00662` and
two-repetition cluster LCB `-0.03395`, below the frozen `-0.01` boundary.
R2B does not weaken that boundary or reuse the old decision name.

## Scientific question

Let

```text
Delta_R(w) = Gamma_R(w) - Gamma_B0(w)
H_O(w)     = Gamma_oracle-swap(w) - Gamma_B0(w)
F_C(w)     = Gamma_R(w) - Gamma_Oest(w)
```

`B0` is the old response-safe chart. `R` is the pre-response RCCA chart.
`Oest` uses the truth-open oracle chart with the same downstream estimator.
The oracle swap is a scoring denominator only.

R2B asks three different questions rather than forcing one sign constraint:

1. In accessible-effect worlds, does `R` recover positive chart headroom?
2. In the history-gated sentinel, is `R` non-inferior to `B0`?
3. In the selection-creation compensation boundary, is `R` non-inferior to
   `Oest`, even when a more faithful chart need not outscore `B0` after
   opposing mechanisms cancel?

## Frozen worlds

Accessible-effect worlds:

- `endogenous_creation_expansion`
- `endogenous_source_partition_matched`
- `source_rotated_feedback`

Safety sentinel:

- `history_gated_ecology`

Structural boundary:

- `selection_creation_compensation`

Null worlds:

- `linear_null_ecology`
- `linear_exogenous_selection`
- `fast_return_equal_marginal`

Each null world has five independent draws per repetition. Eight repetitions
therefore contain 40 main cells and 120 null cells.

## Frozen sampling and inference

- Root seed: `2223719102`
- Author-permutation seed: `537424274`
- CKA-permutation seed: `2839251173`
- Bootstrap seed: `3120088265`
- Independent repetitions: `8`
- CKA permutations per main cell: `199`
- Cluster bootstrap draws: `5000`
- Bootstrap unit: complete repetition
- Ratio draws with non-positive denominator are undefined, not clipped
- Minimum valid ratio-bootstrap fraction: `.975`

## Phase separation

Phase A:

1. Generate only the pre-response condition view.
2. Fit and serialize `B0`, `Br_var`, `Br_rep`, and `R`.
3. Serialize no ecology response, endpoint, author mechanism parameter, oracle
   basis, or geodesic truth.
4. Seal the config, protocol, numerical runtime, source tree, every basis
   bundle, and the complete Stage-A manifest.

Phase B:

1. Require the preregistered Stage-A manifest SHA-256.
2. Verify config, protocol, R1 decision, source, runtime, pre-response digest,
   and bundle hashes before scoring.
3. Open response and oracle truth only after all eight repetitions are sealed.
4. Permit deterministic repetition shards, but aggregate exactly one complete
   `0..7` repetition set.

Any hash, digest, coverage, leakage, or alias failure makes the confirmation
invalid. It cannot be repaired in place.

## Confirmation gates

Accessible effect:

- Mean eligible `Delta_R >= .05`, cluster LCB `> 0`
- Mean recovery `>= .60`, LCB `>= .35`
- Mean accessible efficiency `>= .80`, LCB `>= .50`
- Eligible `R-Oest` LCB `>= -.01`
- Every eligible world has headroom LCB `> 0`
- Every eligible world has recovery LCB `>= .30`
- Every eligible world has at least `7/8` positive repetitions
- Aggregate eligible gain is positive in at least `7/8` repetitions

Controls:

- `R-Br_var` and `R-Br_rep` gain LCBs are both `> 0`
- CKA gain LCBs are `> 0`
- Every main-cell CKA permutation `p <= .01`
- History-sentinel `Delta_R` LCB `>= -.01`
- Compensation-boundary `F_C` LCB `>= -.01`
- Hazard relative-degradation cluster UCB `<= .02`
- Author-permutation gain `<= .01`
- Native RCCA refusal rate `= 0`
- Source-shuffle zero-rank/refusal rate `>= .95`
- Support-shift refusal rate `= 1`
- Latent-alias false-recovery rate `= 0`
- Same-rank/same-trace contract pass rate `= 1`
- Gauge error `<= 1e-6`
- Common-shift error `<= 1e-10`

Null specificity:

- A null cell is a false success when `R-B0 >= .03`
- Wilson 95% upper bound must be `<= .05`
- With 120 null cells, at most one false success is permitted

All gates are conjunctive. Failure closes this estimand under its registered
name. Seeds, worlds, endpoints, thresholds, or arms cannot be changed after
opening Phase B.

## R1 semantic replay audit

R1 was originally frozen with generator SHA-256
`e76ef8e10d88d6c413ba04877b52dac00de5576885d2baeb0702e4fab797fb43`.
The current generator adds a standalone Phase-A pre-response entry point and
has SHA-256
`2d023bfbe26e7b87cdd68e93fd22ae27835e3ba5676eee4fec6617e9d055d19a`.

The complete R1 confirmation was replayed with the current generator and the
original frozen config. The original and replayed artifacts are byte-identical:

```

This licenses the source change as a semantics-preserving extension of the R1
world generator. R2B receives a new source seal and does not reuse the old
generator hash.

```

The Stage-A manifest additionally seals every Python file under
`suica_core/`, the four R2 scripts, runtime versions, and each serialized
chart bundle.

## Claim boundary

A GO would establish only a finite-synthetic conditional response-safe chart
effect: observable repeatability/source alignment identifies a chart that
recovers accessible downstream geometry in three registered worlds, remains
safe in one history sentinel, and tracks the same-estimator oracle chart in
one compensation boundary.

It would not establish:

- universal five-world chart replacement
- causal mechanism recovery
- natural-text transport
- personality, clinical, or behavioral validity
- M4-D readiness
