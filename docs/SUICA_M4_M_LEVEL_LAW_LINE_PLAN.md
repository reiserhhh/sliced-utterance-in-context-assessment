# SUICA M4-M — The Level-Law Completion Line

Line opened 2026-08-11. Question: **can the restored level law
(`field ≈ λ′ − κ′·V_person`, K2f, interpolation-grade) be completed —
its readability exponent identified on a decollinearized corpus, its
predictions sealed at extrapolated configurations, and its tax
coefficient tested for unity across grades?** This line executes K2f's
named follow-up ("a decollinearized corpus for the r-at-level question;
a D1-style seal for the new form") and appendix K's unification
candidate (the κ-invariant).

Tier: EXPLORATORY, label-free, synthetic throughout. The claims ledger
controls. Registrations are appended here BEFORE execution and never
edited after; outcomes are appended after adjudication. Route-index
entry at line synthesis.

## Standing rules (binding on every M-leg)

Rules 1–8 verbatim as in the K-line header
(`docs/SUICA_M4_K_IDENTITY_LINE_PLAN.md:13-30`); rules 9–21 as
canonically tabled in `docs/SUICA_DEFECT_REGISTRY.md` ("The rule set
the defects bought"); rules 22–24 as enacted in the D5 adjudication
(`docs/SUICA_DEFENSE_PHASE_PLAN.md:667-672`): 22 — every band,
tolerance or bound declares its sides; 23 — clauses declare they can do
their job (gate stages named, feasibility argued); 24 — rule 8 extends
to published prose, and report tables carrying artifact numbers are
GENERATED from artifacts, never typed (K2f adjudication convention).
The registry and the originating adjudication texts control over this
shorthand. Unnumbered conventions in force
(`docs/SUICA_DEFECT_REGISTRY.md` "Conventions in force"): round-trip
parsing, df-aware pilots, Part-0 bit-identity verification, chunked
foreground stages, aggregation provenance, salt embedding,
legacy-anchor parser naming; plus the K2f machinery convention — ONE
importlib loader chain per leg (RN-K2F-5).

Execution conventions (binding on dispatched agents): no background
jobs, no monitors — foreground chunked stages with explicit timeouts,
every stage under 600 s; Part 0 gates written into the report BEFORE
any arm runs; bit-exact anchor reproduction from persisted artifacts
before new arms; every anomaly self-reported with an explicit statement
of whether it was resolved before or after any hypothesis-relevant
number existed; exactly ONE commit per leg (`feat(m4-m): ...`), never
amended, never pushed by the agent; `results/` is gitignored —
committed deliverables are the script, the report, the plan-doc outcome
append, and the ledger row. `suica_core/` is frozen and READ-ONLY.

## Line charter (three legs, registered sequentially)

- **M1 — r-at-level on a decollinearized factorial** (registered below).
  The φ knob moves predicted attenuation at EXACTLY fixed V_person
  (`person_share_design` has no φ argument), so a share × φ factorial
  breaks the −0.964 collinearity that made K2f's exponent
  unidentifiable. Was the level law's flatness in r real, or an
  artifact of a corpus that never varied φ below 0.90?
- **M2 — the extrapolation seal** (register ONLY after M1 adjudication;
  blocked if M1 lands NON_IDENTIFIED_UNDERPOWERED). D1-style salted
  prospective seal of the M1-winner's predictions at ≥3 configurations
  OUTSIDE the trained envelope (share above 0.6634207990183637 and/or φ
  outside M1's ladder, with at least one joint-exterior corner), bands
  pre-declared from M1's LOO-RMSE, opened measure-first. 3/3 inside →
  the level law is graded PREDICTIVE (extrapolation); partial → the
  boundary of validity is named.
- **M3 — the one-κ question** (register only after M2 adjudication).
  Is the variance-tax coefficient ONE instrument constant? κ has
  appeared at ~0.72–0.75 in three independent fitting routes plus the
  level refit; M3 measures κ at response grade and level grade across
  new geometries within the frozen instrument's domain, with any
  cross-scale comparison carrying a pinned link (rule 14) or re-designed
  within-instrument. Verdict: common band (an instrument constant, the
  appendix-K species) vs a measured geometry-dependence law.

Line stop conditions: any leg's STOP cell routes back to the planner as
a registration defect before any hypothesis-relevant number exists; the
line closes early if M1 lands R_TERM_ABSENT_AT_LEVEL and M2 seals the
tax-only form (M3 still runs — κ unity is grade-independent).

## M4-M1 — r-at-level on a decollinearized factorial

**REGISTERED 2026-08-11, BEFORE RUN.** Planner: this document's author.
Executor: dispatched agent (implementation and execution only; this
registration text is binding).

### Question

K2f restored the level law as an intercept minus the tax — and proved,
in the same breath, that this corpus cannot say whether the intercept
hides λ·r^q: corr(r, V) = −0.9643543785903034 across the 26 rows,
because the legacy legs exercised φ only at {0.90, 0.98} and moved r
almost entirely through share, which also moves V. M1 asks the question
K2f could not: **at level, with V held fixed by design, does the field
depend on readability — and with what exponent?**

### Design mechanism (why this decollinearizes — verified against artifacts 2026-08-11)

- `person_share_design(share, int_share)` has NO φ argument:
  V(0.40) = 0.12000000000000004, V(0.45) = 0.13500000000000004
  (persisted in `results/m4_k2f_level_law/part0.json:fresh_arm` and
  K2f's ANCHORS). φ therefore moves r at EXACTLY fixed V.
- φ's r-leverage is live in the published corpus:
  r(0.30, 0.90) = 0.6758917867864564 vs r(0.30, 0.98) =
  0.645057248597175; r(0.50, 0.90) = 0.558364277337817 vs
  r(0.50, 0.98) = 0.5193517935368367
  (`results/m4_k2f_level_law/compiled_rows.csv`, round-trip). Higher φ
  → lower r; the ladder below extends φ DOWNWARD to raise r at fixed V.
- Share moves V (and r): the trained share envelope is
  [0.02, 0.6634207990183637]; M1's shares sit strictly inside it.

### Facts cited to motivate leans (rule 8 — verified 2026-08-11 against persisted artifacts at full precision)

- K2f winner F2: λ′ = 0.18021628978547316, q′ = −0.009622064624441264,
  κ′ = 0.750086268225045, p = 0.2064406330042716, LOO-RMSE =
  0.0061559195350209; q′ ci95 [−0.3792124136721057, 0.5313115708778163];
  κ′ ci95 [0.5202855978239498, 0.8612166024267973]
  (`results/m4_k2f_level_law/fits.json`).
- Sealed response-grade constants (D1 bundle, opened in D-open):
  λ = 0.17417497661611914, q = 1.8528700746510731,
  κ_hat = −0.7220359963712748. The sealed composite under-predicted all
  26 compiled levels (residuals −0.1611..−0.0597) — evidence that the
  level r-dependence is WEAKER than r^1.85.
- Response-grade q band: **q = 1.83 [1.71, 1.98]**
  (`docs/SUICA_IDENTITY_THEORY_V1.md:805,841`); cross-leg spread
  1.83–1.93 (fragility annex) is a SECOND reading, not the primary band.
- D-open S-4 anchor: r(0.40, 0.90) = 0.6185853753498524,
  measured b-only level 0.09350089316336324 (K2f script ANCHORS,
  bit-exact against `results/dopen_seal_opening/stage1_m4.json`).

### Machinery (rules 9/12 — source objects pinned)

Instrument: K2b's world family and field reader, loaded through K2f's
loader pattern with ONE loader chain (RN-K2F-5). Source objects:
`run_suica_m4_k2b_t4_branch.py` — `build_k2b_world` / `run_field_world`
(985-author K1-pinned panel, F2 m-multiset, 4 contexts);
`run_suica_m4_k2c_matched_pairs.py:predicted_attenuation` (2-arg, →
k2b:533-583); `run_suica_m4_k2e_double_matching.py:person_share_design`.
Arm configuration inherits K2F-FRESH's carrier verbatim (int_share = 0,
same w_int_arm, same panel pins) except (share, φ). Field statistic:
per-world `recovery_b_only`; cell level = mean over worlds (the
`_level_from_raw` aggregation, K2f lineage). New script:
`scripts/run_suica_m4_m1_r_at_level.py`. Seeds: master_seed 20260811;
main worlds salt `m4m1-world`, hash-derived per (cell, world-index
0..31); pilot salt `m4m1-pilot`, indices 0..3 — disjoint streams by
salt. Round-trip parsing everywhere.

### Design (pinned)

Factorial grid: share ∈ {0.10, 0.25, 0.40, 0.60} × φ ∈ {0.60, 0.70,
0.80, 0.90, 0.98} = 20 cells × 32 worlds = 640 fresh worlds. Shares
strictly inside the trained envelope; φ at 0.60–0.80 is an EXTENSION
beyond the exercised {0.90, 0.98} — disclosed as such, guarded by the
pilot (finiteness, non-degeneracy, liveness), and the law claim stays
scoped to the tested grid.

### Part 0 (ALL written into the report before any world runs)

- **G0m (anchors, bit-exact).** (i) predicted_attenuation(0.40, 0.90)
  == 0.6185853753498524; (ii) predicted_attenuation(0.45, 0.90) ==
  0.5889058864943755 and person_share_design(0.45, 0.0) ==
  0.13500000000000004 (K2f part0 fresh_arm); (iii) person_share_design
  (0.40, 0.0) == 0.12000000000000004; (iv) reload
  `results/m4_k2f_level_law/fits.json` and verify EVERY K2f number
  quoted in this registration bit-exactly (F2 params, LOO, both ci95s)
  — a mismatch is a planner citation defect: STOP, report, do not
  repair silently; (v) re-derive Dopen:M-4's level 0.09350089316336324
  from its raw CSV round-trip; (vi) grep the theory doc and verify the
  quoted response band [1.71, 1.98] appears verbatim — mismatch: STOP
  (rule 24).
- **G1m (design arithmetic — no worlds needed).** Compute the realized
  20-point (r, V) table from the pinned deterministic maps and write it
  into the report. Gates: (a) all shares inside
  [0.02, 0.6634207990183637]; (b) V max/min ≥ 2, with V derived from
  `person_share_design`, never assumed linear; (c) within-share r
  max/min ≥ 1.20 in at least TWO share levels; (d) cross-cell
  |corr(r, V)| ≤ 0.30, with corr(r^1.8528700746510731, V) also
  reported (the headline decollinearization numbers, against K2f's
  −0.9643543785903034); (e) no duplicate (r, V) design points.
  Fallback ladder (rule 17, pre-declared, arithmetic only): if (c) or
  (d) fails, extend φ once to {0.45, 0.60, 0.75, 0.90, 0.98} and
  recheck; still failing → **STOP_DESIGN_INFEASIBLE** (planner
  registration defect).
- **G2m (pilot, rule 17 — AFTER G0m/G1m, before main arms).** 4 corner
  cells (share ∈ {0.10, 0.60} × φ ∈ {0.60, 0.98}) × 4 worlds on the
  pilot salt. Checks: (i) all per-world fields finite, non-saturated;
  (ii) **liveness (rule 3)**: at share 0.60, the realized attenuation
  contrast between φ = 0.60 and φ = 0.98 exceeds 2× its pooled SE —
  using the k2b-side realized card-attenuation statistic if one is
  persisted per world (executor pins the source object file:line in
  Part 0; rule 12), else the pilot field contrast at the same corner
  (declared fallback: a liveness check on the outcome, catastrophic
  deadness only). Liveness failure → drop φ extension, fall back to
  exercised-range ladder {0.90, 0.92, 0.94, 0.96, 0.98}, re-run G1m +
  G3m-b; failure there → STOP_DESIGN_INFEASIBLE.
- **G3m (satisfiability/power, rules 11/18/21/23).**
  (a) Sides for every clause (rule 22) written in Part 0.
  (b) **Projected identification power** (the rule-11 check made real):
  σ_w = pooled per-world sd across the 16 pilot worlds, inflated by the
  df-aware factor sqrt(12 / χ²_{0.10, df=12}); then a parametric
  replication (B_proj = 500, seed = master) of the 20-cell experiment
  at truths (λ = 0.18021628978547316, κ = 0.750086268225045, ε = 0)
  × q_truth ∈ {1.0, 1.8528700746510731}, cell noise
  N(0, σ_w²/32), fitting form F1 with the full start grid; width proxy
  = quantile(q̂, .975) − quantile(q̂, .025). Gate: proxy ≤ 0.50 under
  BOTH truths (stricter than L-1's 0.60 to absorb proxy slack,
  disclosed). No projection at q_truth = 0 — structural
  non-identification there is cell R_TERM_ABSENT's subject, not a
  power failure (stated per rule 20's spirit: that branch is
  pre-declared adjudicable, not empty).
  (c) Stage estimates: part0 60 s, pilot 30 s, worlds 4 × 120 s
  (5 cells per chunk), fit 300 s, finalize 60 s; the 2×
  stop-and-report threshold convention applies.
- **G4m (hygiene).** Rule-16 truth table written verbatim into the
  report (below); rule 24: every report table carrying artifact
  numbers is generated from artifacts.

### Fits (pinned)

Fit on the 20 cell means (world-level fitting is minimizer-identical at
equal cell n; noted, not run). FOUR pre-declared forms, no others:

- F1: field = λ·r^q − κ·V (K2f lineage);
- F1e: field = λ·r^q − κ·V − ε, ε bounded [0, 0.05] (T4's nonnegative
  species floor; 0.05 = 3.3× the fragile ≤0.015 band ceiling; the ONLY
  bounded form, stated); near q ≈ 0 its (λ, ε) ridge is singular —
  disclosed; LOO pays for it;
- F2: field = λ·r^q − κ·V·r^p (K2f lineage);
- F3: field = (λ − κ·V)·r^q (K2f lineage).

Optimizer: K2f's OPT verbatim (scipy least_squares, trf, 2-point jac,
ftol/xtol/gtol 1e-14, max_nfev 20000, unbounded except F1e's ε).
Start grid (pinned; K2f's grid extended by q ∈ {−0.5, 0.0} on K2f's
own finding): λ ∈ {0.05, 0.17417497661611914, 0.5}; q ∈ {−0.5, 0.0,
0.5, 1.0, 1.8528700746510731, 3.0}; κ ∈ {0.0, 0.7220359963712748,
2.0}; p ∈ {0.0, 1.0, 1.8528700746510731}; ε ∈ {0.0, 0.01, 0.03}.
Selection by leave-one-CELL-out RMSE (20 refits per form, full grid +
full-data optimum). Parameter CIs: within-cell world-block bootstrap —
each draw resamples 32 world indices with replacement INDEPENDENTLY
per cell, recomputes the 20 cell means, refits from the full-data
optimum start; B = 2000, seed = master; K2f discard rules
(non-convergence, |param| ≥ 1e6), counts disclosed. Cells are never
dropped (the design is fixed; the uncertainty is world sampling within
cells — stated against K2f's row-resample, which faced a different
object). Rule 13: any verdict within Monte-Carlo error of its boundary
re-runs at B = 20000 and scores BOUNDARY if unstable. Tie rule
(pre-declared): if the top two forms' LOO-RMSE differ by < 5% of the
winner's, every verdict must agree across both, else that verdict
reports SPLIT with both values.

### Leans (sides declared, rule 22)

- **L-1 [prior .55] IDENTIFIED:** the LOO winner's q 95% bootstrap CI
  width ≤ 0.60. One-sided (smaller is better).
- **L-2 [conditional on L-1; priors below/overlap/above =
  .55/.35/.10]:** the winner's q CI against the response band
  [1.71, 1.98] — three outcomes, all named: entirely below / overlap /
  entirely above. Two-sided; every outcome informative. Registered
  lean: BELOW (the sealed composite under-predicts all 26 levels; the
  level picture at controlled V is intercept-like; the response-grade
  q was fitted on a pooled curve sharing K2f's collinearity).
- **L-3 [prior .70] TAX STABILITY:** the winner's κ CI overlaps K2f
  F2's κ′ ci95 [0.5202855978239498, 0.8612166024267973]. Two-sided
  overlap; disjoint-low and disjoint-high both named.
- **L-4 (reading, NO gate): (r, V)-sufficiency probe.** Within each
  share level, Spearman(residual, φ) across the 5 φ cells, per share,
  under the winner's fit; a monotone same-sign pattern in ≥3/4 share
  levels is the named finding "φ leaks past (r, V)" — T4's
  form-sufficiency questioned; reported, adjudicating nothing.

### Routing (rules 15/16 — the truth table, every realizable combination to exactly one outcome)

| # | condition | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | any Part-0/pilot gate fails after its declared ladder | **STOP_DESIGN_INFEASIBLE** (planner defect; no fit is run) |
| 2 | L-1 MISS AND winner λ CI contains 0 | **R_TERM_ABSENT_AT_LEVEL** — the tax-only level law is the COMPLETE level story on this family; level–response dissociation named; q-at-level closes as structurally unposed; M2 proceeds on the tax-only form |
| 3 | L-1 MISS AND winner λ CI excludes 0 | **NON_IDENTIFIED_UNDERPOWERED** — CI reported, no q claim; M2 blocked; leverage redesign named |
| 4 | L-1 HOLD AND L-2 below | **LEVEL_RESPONSE_DISSOCIATION** — q measured at level, below the response band; new named phenomenon; M2 seals the measured law |
| 5 | L-1 HOLD AND L-2 overlap | **SINGLE_EXPONENT_RESTORED** — T4's level form completed with the response exponent; M2 seals |
| 6 | L-1 HOLD AND L-2 above | **ABOVE_BAND_ANOMALY** — named; M2 seals the measured law; theory note required |
| — | L-3 disjoint (either side), any cell 2–6 | modifier **TAX_SHIFT_AT_LEVEL** — pre-registered anomaly fed into M3's charter |
| — | L-3 overlap, any cell 2–6 | modifier: κ's fourth independent appearance is counted |

L-2/L-3 are evaluated only in cells 2–6's L-1 HOLD branches where they
are defined (L-2 needs an identified q; in cell 2 the q question is
unposed and L-2 is recorded N/A; L-3 is evaluated in every cell 2–6
since κ is identified even where q is not — in cell 3, L-3 is reported
descriptively, adjudicating nothing). This enumeration is the full
partition (rule 16); the executor reproduces it in the report verbatim.

### Deliverables and budget

The six deliverables as always: (1)
`scripts/run_suica_m4_m1_r_at_level.py`; (2) artifacts under
`results/m4_m1_r_at_level/` (gitignored); (3)
`reports/SUICA_M4_M1_R_AT_LEVEL_REPORT.md` (tables generated from
artifacts); (4) outcome appended to THIS section (append-only); (5) one
`docs/CLAIMS_LEDGER.md` row (EXPLORATORY); (6) exactly ONE commit
`feat(m4-m): M1 — r-at-level on a decollinearized factorial — <SLUG>`,
never amended, never pushed. Suite (`python -m pytest -q -p
no:cacheprovider`) green before commit. Budget: ~640 worlds ≈ 0.6 s
each plus fits — target < 25 min wall, every stage < 600 s.

### Outcome (appended 2026-08-11 by the executing agent; append-only)

**`STOP_DESIGN_INFEASIBLE` — rule-16 cell 1 (a Part-0 gate fails after its
declared ladder; no fit is run).** Report:
`reports/SUICA_M4_M1_R_AT_LEVEL_REPORT.md`; harness
`scripts/run_suica_m4_m1_r_at_level.py`; artifacts `results/m4_m1_r_at_level/`.
**0 worlds were generated.** The leg stopped inside Part 0,
before the pilot, on this registration's own pre-declared fallback ladder.

**G0m PASSES completely — there is no citation defect.** Every anchor and every
K2f, D-open and theory-document number this registration quotes re-derives
bit-exactly: `predicted_attenuation(0.40, 0.90)`, `(0.45, 0.90)`,
`person_share_design(0.45, 0.0)` and `(0.40, 0.0)`; K2f F2's λ′, q′, κ′, p, its
LOO-RMSE at both persisted paths (`fits.json:L-1.best_loo_rmse` and
`loo.json:loo.F2.loo_rmse`) and both ci95s; D-open's M-4 level
0.09350089316336324 re-derived as the round-trip mean of its raw per-world
CSV; and `-0.9643543785903034` reproduced from `compiled_rows.csv` under Pearson,
which is what pins RN-M1-4's reading of "corr". The registration's facts are
accurate and its **mechanism is real**: φ does move `r` at exactly fixed `V`.

**G1m fails at gate (d), and the fallback ladder does not save it.** On the
registered base ladder `[0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.98]`, gate (c) reached the
1.2 within-share `r` ratio in only **1** of 4 share
levels against a requirement of 2, and gate (d) measured
`corr(r, V) = -0.9407871367652862`. The pre-declared one-step extension to
`[0.45, 0.6, 0.75, 0.9, 0.98]` fired automatically inside Part 0 and did exactly its job on
(c) — **2**/4 levels, realized ratios
`[1.0525449708005403, 1.13540425278654, 1.2242247054603972, 1.3546050387988702]` — while (d) moved only to `-0.9107365249638539`,
**3.03578841654618× the 0.3 bar**. The failure is not an artifact
of the correlation convention: Spearman gives `-0.9306800811953776` and
`corr(r^q, V)` at the sealed response exponent gives `-0.9213071767159029`.
Gates (a), (b) and (e) pass (20 distinct design
points, `V` from 0.03000000000000001 to 0.18000000000000005, ratio 6.0).

**The bar is not merely missed — it is unreachable.** RN-M1-8's `diagnose` stage
(pure design arithmetic on the pinned deterministic maps; no world, no field, no
fit) searched the whole knob space. Over **every** 5-point distinct φ ladder in
(0.001, 0.999) at the registered shares, the infimum of `|corr(r, V)|` is
**`0.748768093111513` = 2.4958936437050436× the bar**, attained at the degenerate
ladder `[0.001, 0.011081, 0.021162, 0.988919, 0.999]` — the most extreme φ leverage this family can produce.
Freeing the shares as well, inside gate (a)'s envelope and subject to gate (b)'s
`V max/min ≥ 2.0`, the best of 4000 seeded draws
(474 rejected by (b)) is `0.5208187741410987` =
1.736062580470329× the bar. And the G2m liveness fallback ladder
`[0.9, 0.92, 0.94, 0.96, 0.98]`, had it ever been
reached, would have made (d) **worse** at
`-0.99515544292931` — every escape route
this registration wrote leads away from its own gate.

**Why, mechanically.** `V` is an EXACT linear function of share in this family
(`V/share = 0.3` at every share tested), and `r` is monotone
decreasing in share, so share drives `r` and `V` in lockstep. φ is the only knob
orthogonal to `V`, and its TOTAL leverage across the full open interval is
`0.05159009087311539` in `r` at share 0.1 rising to
`0.21722718146551878` at share 0.6 — against a
between-share `r` span of `0.2909602839380743` at fixed φ. Gate (b) REQUIRES a
share range wide enough that `V` varies by 2×, which is precisely what makes the
between-share `r` spread dominate; gate (d) requires the within-share φ-driven
spread to dominate instead. **In this world family both cannot hold at once.**
A second consequence, worth its own line: gate (c)'s 1.2 ratio is
reachable in only **2 of the 4 registered share
levels for any φ ladder whatsoever** (at shares `[0.1, 0.25]` the
full open φ interval tops out at ratios
1.06718684974016 and
1.1762868144261993), so "at least
2 share levels" was unknowingly demanding *all* the levels
that can ever comply.

**The defect (the planner owns it).** Rule-11 satisfiability, and rule-18 JOINT satisfiability across clauses sharing generative knobs: gate (b) and gate (d) share `share`, and the registration checked neither jointly nor arithmetically against the bar it wrote. The registration's own cited facts already contained the warning -- it quotes r(0.30, 0.90) = 0.6758917867864564 vs r(0.30, 0.98) = 0.645057248597175, a 4.78% move, and never asked what correlation a knob that small can buy against a share axis that moves r by 0.2910 at fixed phi.

**What was NOT run.** G2m's 16-world pilot, G3m(b)'s power projection (it needs
pilot σ_w), the 640 main worlds, and the fit — cell 1 reads
"no fit is run" and the ordering puts the pilot after the Part-0 gates. L-1,
L-2, L-3 and L-4 are all recorded **NOT EVALUATED**, with the reason in the
report's lean table. The four pre-declared forms, the start grid, the optimizer
pins, the bootstrap spec and every rule-22 side were nevertheless fixed in Part 0
before the stop and are persisted in `part0.json`, so a re-registration inherits
them unchanged rather than re-deriving them.

**Where the leverage would have to come from (a question for the planner, not an
executor's choice — nothing here is adopted).** As long as the only two knobs are
share and φ, `V` *is* share and the design has one effective axis plus a weak
second. Decollinearizing `r` from `V` at level needs either a knob that moves `r`
without moving share, or a `V` that is not a function of share alone.
`person_share_design(share, int_share)` sums the slow AND interaction shares, so
the `int_share` carrier — which M1 pinned to zero by inheriting K2F-FRESH
verbatim — moves `V` at fixed share. That is a second axis in exactly the place
the current design has none.

**Anomalies, with timing. No hypothesis-relevant number ever existed in this
leg** (0 worlds, no fit), so every anomaly below is
pre-hypothesis by construction. **A-1 (before any number of any kind):** the
dispatched environment did not exist — the only pandas on this machine belongs to
CPython 3.9.6, and the published machinery imports `datetime.UTC` (3.11+), so
`k2b`/`k2c`/`k2d`/`k2e` and the K2f harness all fail to import there; a CPython
3.12.12 venv was built outside the repo from `requirements-lock-main.txt`
verbatim (numpy `2.4.4`, pandas `3.0.2`, scipy `1.17.1` —
the lock's own pins) and the full suite was run green on it BEFORE any leg code
was written. **A-2 (before Part 0):** macOS ships no `timeout(1)`, so each stage
ran as its own foreground command under an explicit harness timeout. **A-3 (Part
0):** the rule-17 ladder fired — recorded because the firing is itself an event.
**A-4:** Part 0 ran more than once, every run before any world, deterministic and
identical each time; the ordering log was reset once so it carries the clean
final pass end to end. **A-5:** a first exploratory diagnostic called
`predicted_attenuation` inside an optimizer loop, overran its foreground timeout
and was killed; it was rewritten to precompute `r` on a fixed
100-point φ grid (2.072169780731201 s) and **no number from the
killed run appears anywhere in this leg**. **A-6 — rule 24 caught three of this
leg's own errors before commit:** the φ-leverage move at share 0.30 hand-typed as
"4.6%" where the anchors give `4.780124284524867`%; a leverage table whose headers
read "r at phi min/max" while the cells carry `r.min()`/`r.max()`, which are the
OPPOSITE φ endpoints since `r` decreases in φ; and a `V max/min ≥ 6.0` that
quoted the design's realized ratio where the gate's bar is
2.0. All three are now generated from artifacts.
**A-7:** no stage approached its 2× threshold — Part 0 `0.0369420051574707` s
against a 60 s estimate, `diagnose` `2.072169780731201` s against a 120 s
executor estimate.

**Line consequence.** M2 was registered as blocked only on
`NON_IDENTIFIED_UNDERPOWERED`; cell 1 is a different stop — nothing about the
level law was measured, so nothing about it was learned, and M2's charter is
untouched but unfed. M3 (the one-κ question) is independent of this leg and is
not blocked by it.

### Planner adjudication (2026-08-11, appended after the run) — THE STOP IS ACCEPTED; THE DEFECTS ARE MINE

**STOP_DESIGN_INFEASIBLE accepted as delivered.** The executor's conduct
was exemplary: G0m bit-exact on every quoted number (no citation
defect), ZERO worlds spent, the gate failure PROVEN unsatisfiable
rather than merely observed (infimum |corr(r, V)| over every 5-point φ
ladder at the registered shares = 0.748768093111513 = 2.496× the bar;
with shares freed under gate (b), best found 0.5208187741410987 — an
upper bound on that infimum, itself already 1.74× the bar), and rule 24
catching three of its own report cells pre-commit.

**Defect #43 (rule 11 violated in its letter).** G1m(d) was
deterministic arithmetic from pinned source objects — computable by the
planner at registration time with no pilot and no world. It was not
computed. The planner extrapolated φ's r-leverage from the two
published points (φ ∈ {0.90, 0.98}) into an unexercised region where
the attenuation map SATURATES: total φ leverage over the open interval
is 0.0516–0.2172 in r against a between-share span of 0.2910.

**Defect #44 (rule 18 violated).** Gates (b), (c), (d) share the
`share` knob and pull in opposite directions — (b) demands a wide share
range (V max/min ≥ 2), which is exactly what makes r track V; (d)
demands the within-share spread dominate. The joint check was not run;
the executor's diagnostic proves (b)+(d) jointly empty at ANY
admissible shares. Inside the same defect: gate (c)'s "≥ 2 of 4 share
levels" unknowingly named the only two levels that can EVER comply
(shares 0.10/0.25 top out at ratios 1.067/1.176 for any φ ladder).

**The deeper reading, and the rule it buys.** The failed bar sat on a
PROXY. Marginal corr(r, V) across cells is not what identification
needs: in a factorial, q is identified from within-share φ sweeps at
EXACTLY fixed V, and κ from between-share contrasts — the marginal
correlation can stay high while the conditional design information is
ample. The registration made the proxy a hard gate and left the
estimand-relevant object (the G3m-b projection) downstream of it, so
the leg died on a number the estimand does not consume. K2f's
follow-up phrase ("arms chosen to BREAK the r/V collinearity") seeded
the framing: "break the collinearity" was operationalized as "drive a
marginal correlation below a bar," where the operative content of
K2f's complaint was "restore identification" — K2f's collinearity
harmed it because that corpus ALSO had no within-stratum sweeps; the
factorial restores the sweeps, which is what suffices. **Rule 25
(enacted):** every design-feasibility gate is stated in the quantity
the leg's estimand requires (identification width, power, a registered
projection); marginal or proxy statistics of the design are REPORTED,
never gating. **Convention (planner-side):** when every input to a
registered gate is deterministic arithmetic from pinned source
objects, the planner RUNS the gate before committing the registration
and embeds the computed table in the registration text.

**Carried forward.** M1's Part-0 pins (four forms, optimizer, start
grid) inherit into M1b unchanged; the executor's leverage table is
M1b's design basis; leans and priors inherit UNCHANGED — zero worlds
ran, so no hypothesis-relevant information exists to update on.
Registry: #43, #44 and rule 25 appended by dated note. Appendix W is
untouched by this stop (it concerns the fit family, which never ran).

## M4-M1b — r-at-level, feasibility restated in the estimand's quantity

**REGISTERED 2026-08-11, BEFORE RUN.** Re-registration of M1 after its
cell-1 STOP. Planner: this document's author; executor: dispatched
agent (implementation and execution only; this text is binding).
Question, machinery, source objects, seeds policy, forms F1/F1e/F2/F3,
optimizer pins, start grid, LOO-cell selection, within-cell
world-block bootstrap (B = 2000; 20000 at rule-13 boundaries), tie
rule at 5%, leans L-1 [.55] / L-2 [below/overlap/above = .55/.35/.10,
conditional on L-1] / L-3 [.70] / L-4 (reading), and the rule-16 truth
table cells 2–6 with modifiers are INHERITED VERBATIM from M4-M1
above. Exactly the following changes.

### Design (pinned; planner arithmetic RUN at registration — rule 11 discharged, rule 25 compliant)

Grid: share ∈ {0.10, 0.25, 0.40, 0.60} × φ ∈ {0.05, 0.30, 0.60, 0.85,
0.98} = 20 cells × 32 worlds/cell. master_seed 20260811; salts
`m4m1b-world` / `m4m1b-pilot` (fresh streams; disjoint from M1's by
salt). φ at {0.05, 0.30, 0.60, 0.85} is a regime EXTENSION beyond the
exercised {0.90, 0.98} — guarded by G2m′, and the law claim stays
scoped to the tested grid.

Planner-computed design table (via the pinned maps, executor
reproduces bit-exactly in Part 0 — G0m′(vii)):

| share | V_person | r(φ=.05) | r(φ=.30) | r(φ=.60) | r(φ=.85) | r(φ=.98) | span |

Descriptives (REPORTED, never gating — rule 25): marginal corr(r, V) =
−0.8495063312353189; corr(r^1.8528700746510731, V) =
−0.8649603255864755; against K2f's −0.9643543785903034. The
identification content lives in the within-share sweeps (V exactly
fixed by design), not in the marginal correlation — that sentence is
the rule-25 exemplar.

Pre-declared ALT ladder (fires ONLY on G2m′'s regime guard): φ ∈
{0.30, 0.55, 0.75, 0.90, 0.98}; planner table: spans
0.04374938456031985 / 0.09976111056538539 / 0.1438755667421826 /
0.1805503468260165 by share; corr(r, V) = −0.8915685583022667;
corr(r^q, V) = −0.9029258027968385; also passes G1m′ below.

### Gates

- **G0m′ (anchors, bit-exact).** (i)–(vi) as M1's G0m verbatim (all
  passed in M1; re-verify); (vii) reproduce BOTH planner design tables
  above bit-exactly from `predicted_attenuation` /
  `person_share_design`; (viii) verify the M1-STOP numbers cited in
  the adjudication above against `results/m4_m1_r_at_level/`
  (stop_diagnostic.json and the report tables): infimum
  0.748768093111513, freed-shares bound 0.5208187741410987, per-share
  full-interval spans 0.05159009087311539 / 0.11784317303319514 /
  0.17083747134975158 / 0.21722718146551878. Any mismatch → STOP
  (citation defect, not silently repaired).
- **G1m′ (arithmetic; planner-verified at registration, executor
  re-runs).** (a) shares inside [0.02, 0.6634207990183637] — PASS. (b)
  V max/min ≥ 2 — realized 6.0, PASS. (c′) within-share r-span ≥ 0.12
  at BOTH shares {0.40, 0.60} — realized 0.15863752656482977 /
  0.20320393707216905 (ALT: 0.1438755667421826 / 0.1805503468260165),
  PASS. (e) 20/20 distinct design points — PASS. There is NO
  marginal-correlation gate (rule 25).
- **G2m′ (pilot; AFTER G0m′/G1m′, before any main world).** Corners
  {0.10, 0.60} × {0.05, 0.98} × 4 worlds on `m4m1b-pilot`. (i) REGIME
  guard: finite, non-saturated, nonzero within-corner variance;
  failure at a φ-extension corner → ALT ladder once (re-run G1m′ and
  G3m′(b)), then STOP_DESIGN_INFEASIBLE. (ii) φ→r channel liveness:
  PRIMARY object = a per-world realized card-attenuation statistic if
  the k2b machinery persists one (executor pins the source object
  file:line in Part 0 — rule 12; requirement: contrast between φ .05
  and .98 at share .60 exceeds 2× its pooled SE). If no such statistic
  exists, liveness is certified by the pinned map's arithmetic (Δr =
  0.20320393707216905 at share .60) PLUS the projection — an
  OUTCOME-side field contrast is NOT a liveness gate here, because a
  flat field is cell-2 EVIDENCE, not channel death; M1's registration
  conflated these and M1b does not (rule 25 applied twice).
- **G3m′.** (a) sides per rule 22 as in M1. (b) **the feasibility
  gate — the only one:** σ_w = pooled per-world sd across the 16 pilot
  worlds, inflated by sqrt(12 / χ²_{0.10, df=12}); parametric
  replication B_proj = 500, seed = master, at truths
  (λ = 0.18021628978547316, κ = 0.750086268225045, ε = 0) × q_truth ∈
  {1.0, 1.8528700746510731}, cell noise N(0, σ_w²/32), fitting F1
  with the full start grid; width proxy = quantile(q̂, .975) −
  quantile(q̂, .025); PASS iff proxy ≤ 0.50 under BOTH truths.
  Escalation (pre-declared, once): on fail, recompute at 64
  worlds/cell (noise /√2); pass → the main grid runs at 64 worlds/cell
  (budget ×2, declared); fail again → STOP as **NON_PROJECTABLE**,
  with the int_share second axis (V moves at fixed share;
  species-disclosed, K2d dispatcher required) NAMED for a future
  registration, not adopted here. No projection at q_truth = 0
  (pre-declared adjudicable branch, as in M1). (c) Stage estimates:
  part0 60 s, pilot 40 s, worlds 4 × 150 s (5 cells per chunk; ×2 at
  escalation), fit 300 s, finalize 60 s; the 2× stop-and-report
  convention applies.
- **G4m′.** As M1's G4m: the inherited truth table reproduced verbatim
  in the report with cell 1 now reading "any G0m′/G1m′/G2m′/G3m′
  clause fails after its declared ladder → STOP (planner defect)";
  rule 24 — every table carrying artifact numbers generated from
  artifacts.

### Deliverables and budget

The six deliverables: `scripts/run_suica_m4_m1b_r_at_level.py`;
`results/m4_m1b_r_at_level/` (gitignored);
`reports/SUICA_M4_M1B_R_AT_LEVEL_REPORT.md` (generated tables);
outcome appended HERE (append-only); one `docs/CLAIMS_LEDGER.md` row
(EXPLORATORY); exactly ONE commit
`feat(m4-m): M1b — r-at-level, estimand-gated — <SLUG>`, never
amended, never pushed. Suite green before commit. Budget: 640 worlds
(1280 at escalation) ≈ 0.6 s each plus fits — target < 30 min wall,
every stage < 600 s.

### Outcome (appended 2026-08-11 by the executing agent; append-only)

**`NON_PROJECTABLE` — rule-16 cell 1, via G3m′(b) failing after its once-only
escalation.** Report: `reports/SUICA_M4_M1B_R_AT_LEVEL_REPORT.md`; harness
`scripts/run_suica_m4_m1b_r_at_level.py`; artifacts `results/m4_m1b_r_at_level/`.
**16 pilot worlds ran; 0 main worlds were
generated and no fit was run.**

**Rule 25 is validated in BOTH directions by this one leg, and that is the
headline.** It carried M1b PAST a marginal `corr(r, V)` of `-0.8495063312353189`
(`corr(r^q, V) = -0.8649603255864755`) — nearly 3× M1's withdrawn 0.30 bar, now
correctly REPORTED and gating nothing. It then STOPPED the leg on the quantity
the estimand actually consumes. Two different failures; only the second is
information.

**G0m′ PASSES on all eight clauses.** (i)–(vi) re-verified from M1. **(vii): both
of the planner's embedded design tables reproduce BIT-EXACTLY** — every `r`,
every `V`, all four spans on the main ladder, all four ALT spans, and all four
descriptives (`-0.8495063312353189`, `-0.8649603255864755`,
`-0.8915685583022667`,
`-0.9029258027968385`). The planner ran its own arithmetic before committing, as
the convention defect #43 bought requires, and it is correct to the last bit.
**(viii): the M1-STOP numbers cited in the adjudication verify against this
executor's own `results/m4_m1_r_at_level/`** — infimum `0.748768093111513`,
freed-shares bound `0.5208187741410987`, and all four full-interval spans.
**G1m′ PASSES**: (a), (b) (V ratio 6.0), (c′) — the absolute-span
repair — at `[0.15863752656482977, 0.20320393707216905]` against a `0.12` bar, and (e) 20/20
distinct points. Machinery inheritance was not asserted but PROVEN: the copied
harness was compared against the imported M1 module and all four forms fit a
fixed probe bit-identically, with identical start grids, optimizer dict and
inherited bars (RN-M1B-1).

**G2m′ PASSES, and its liveness clause is the registration's second
vindication.** All four corners finite, non-saturated, nonzero variance. The
φ→r channel is alive beyond argument: the realized card attenuation moves
`0.20325550047558588` between φ .05 and .98 at share .60 =
**94.8954999654606× its pooled SE**, landing `5.156340341683219e-05` from the
pinned map's predicted `Δr = 0.20320393707216905`. **The FIELD at that same
corner moves `-0.007269536568279722` = 0.7542598230697173× its pooled SE —
flat within noise.** M1's registration would have gated on exactly that number
as its declared fallback and the leg would have died a SECOND false death, on
evidence that the field does not respond to φ, which is the very thing the leg
exists to measure. M1b's text forbids it in advance ("a flat field is cell-2
EVIDENCE, not channel death"), written before the number existed. Read honestly
that flatness is weak evidence toward cell 2 (`R_TERM_ABSENT_AT_LEVEL`) — four
worlds against four at one share — and it adjudicates NOTHING here.

**G3m′(b) FAILS — the stop.** σ_w = `0.019489117988137468` pooled over the 16 pilot
worlds (df 12), df-inflated by `1.3797155080850578` to **`0.026889438327132725`**.
Projected 95% width of q̂ at 32 worlds/cell: `0.6446327208199195` at q_truth 1.0 and
`1.1702741415331803` at q_truth 1.8528700746510731, against the `0.5`
bar — both fail. The pre-declared once-only escalation FIRED. At 64
worlds/cell: `0.45036131116284384` (CLEARS) and `0.8082914682805795` (does not). The
registration requires BOTH. **Gate FAIL → NON_PROJECTABLE.** The failure is
PRECISION, not pathology: median q̂ tracks its truth at every configuration
({'1.0': 1.0021891019795262, '1.8528700746510731': 1.8442504925087377} at n=32) and zero replicates failed to converge.

**What n WOULD suffice — measured, not extrapolated.** Defect #43 was an
extrapolation where arithmetic was available; the handoff does not repeat it.
On a declared geometric ladder `[64, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512]`, running the binding truth until
it clears and confirming the other truth there: **192 worlds/cell** is
the smallest passing rung (widths `[0.7859406063487944, 0.5516920936367253, 0.45033528452170346]` at `[64, 128, 192]`),
with the non-binding truth confirming at `0.2531601642892628`. That is
**3840 worlds, 6.0× the registered base budget** — at
~0.6 s/world a wall-clock change, not a feasibility change. Precision caveat,
disclosed: the ladder re-drew the n=64 binding cell on a fresh stream and got
`0.7859406063487944` where the gate got `0.8082914682805795` (abs diff
`0.02235086193178515`), so the width proxy itself carries ~2.8%
Monte-Carlo error at B_proj = 500 and 192 should not be read as exact.

**This is NOT a registration defect and should not be recorded as one.** Every
clause was satisfiable, every bar was computed at registration, the ladder and
the escalation both fired exactly as written, and the gate returned a
well-defined verdict on a well-posed quantity. `NON_PROJECTABLE` is a
pre-declared outcome of a SOUND registration. **One judgement call is flagged
for the planner, not as a defect but as a choice worth revisiting:** the
two-truth conjunction is decided entirely by q_truth = 1.8528700746510731,
while the registered L-2 lean puts .55 on q being BELOW the response band. At
q_truth = 1.0 the escalated design already clears at
`0.45036131116284384`. Larger q means smaller r^q on r < 1, so the exponent's signal
shrinks and its interval widens — the gate is hardest exactly where the leg
thinks the truth is not. Whether that conjunction is intended conservatism or
over-strict is the planner's to settle; the executor scored it as written and
takes no position.

**Three routes, none adopted here.** (1) Buy the precision: 192
worlds/cell. (2) Re-state the gate if the two-truth conjunction is stricter than
intended — it would pass at 64 today under a lean-weighted or q-anchored
variant. (3) The int_share second axis, which this registration NAMES and
forbids adopting: it was therefore NOT probed, because exercising it requires
installing K2d's `int:` dispatcher on every reachable k2b instance (RN-K2F-5), a
machinery mutation this leg has no licence to make for a knob it may not adopt —
and under the planner-side convention #43 bought, that arithmetic is the
PLANNER's to run before registering a successor. It is deterministic and needs
no world.

**Anomalies, with timing.** The hypothesis-relevant boundary here is the PILOT:
before it no outcome-side number existed; after it the field contrast and σ_w
did; no lean was ever scored. **A-1/A-2 (before Part 0):** the M4-M1 environment
is reused verbatim — a CPython 3.12.12 venv outside the repo from
`requirements-lock-main.txt` (numpy `2.4.4`, pandas `3.0.2`, scipy
`1.17.1`), because this machine's only pandas belongs to CPython 3.9.6
which cannot import the published machinery; and macOS ships no `timeout(1)`, so
each stage ran as its own foreground command under an explicit harness timeout.
**A-3 (AT the pilot — the first hypothesis-relevant number):** the outcome-side
flatness above; it changed no gate because the registration had already removed
the field from the liveness clause BEFORE the number existed. **A-4 (after
σ_w):** the gate failed and the escalation fired, once, exactly as pre-declared.
**A-5:** RN-M1B-8 (the n-ladder) was added after σ_w existed — disclosed; it
consumes only σ_w and the pinned maps, no lean-relevant quantity, and adopts
nothing. **A-6:** the Monte-Carlo discrepancy at the one overlapping
configuration, disclosed above rather than smoothed. **A-6b — rule 24 caught a
claim in this leg's own prose pre-commit:** the liveness paragraph first said the
realized card contrast "agrees bit-exactly" with the pinned map's Δr; it does
not and could not (a measurement over 8 worlds against deterministic algebra),
they differ by `5.156340341683219e-05`, and the sentence is now generated from
both values. **A-7:** no stage approached its 2× threshold — Part 0
`1.9119329452514648` s vs 60, pilot `9.718364953994751` s vs 40, power
`82.15909004211426` s vs 120, diagnose `79.69169306755066` s vs 300.

**Line consequence.** M2 was registered as blocked on
`NON_IDENTIFIED_UNDERPOWERED`; this is a different stop and reaches it earlier —
the level law's exponent is not merely unidentified on the data, it is priced:
identification at the registered width costs 192 worlds/cell on this
design. M2's charter is untouched but still unfed. M3 (the one-κ question) is
independent of this leg and remains unblocked — and note that κ, unlike q, was
never the binding difficulty in any projection here.

### Planner adjudication of M1b (2026-08-11, appended after the run) — THE GATE WORKED; FUND THE MEASURED BUDGET

**NON_PROJECTABLE accepted as delivered. Zero registration defects** —
the first M-line leg on which the registration survived contact whole:
every clause satisfiable, every bar computed at registration, ladder
and escalation fired exactly as written, and the gate returned a
well-defined verdict on a well-posed quantity (σ_w =
0.026889438327132725 df-inflated; q-widths 1.1702741415331803 /
0.6446327208199195 at n=32 and 0.8082914682805795 /
0.45036131116284384 at n=64, truths 1.8528700746510731 / 1.0).

**Rule 25 validated in both directions by one leg, on the record.**
(i) It carried the leg PAST marginal corr(r, V) = −0.8495063312353189
— which M1's withdrawn proxy gate would have killed at Part 0. (ii) It
prevented a second false death at the pilot: the card channel moved
0.20325550047558588 = 94.90× pooled SE while the field at the same
corner moved −0.007269536568279722 = 0.754× SE — M1's declared
fallback would have gated on that flatness and killed the leg on what
is in fact WEAK CELL-2 EVIDENCE (the field not responding to φ is a
possible ANSWER, not channel death). Recorded as the rule's first
double exemplar.

**The executor's flagged judgement call is answered, and kept.** The
two-truth conjunction is decided by the q = 1.853 truth while L-2's
registered lean puts .55 on the truth being BELOW the band — the gate
is hardest exactly where the planner thinks the truth is not. That is
DELIBERATE and it stays in M1c: the instrument must be able to REFUTE
the lean, not merely confirm it; power against the disfavored
hypothesis is what makes the .55 falsifiable rather than
self-fulfilling.

**A planner note on the pilot whisper (adjudicating nothing).** At the
share-.60 corner the observed field contrast −0.0073 sits ≈5 pooled-SE
below the ≈ +0.041 that a (λ = 0.180, q = 1.853) LEVEL-truth predicts
across that corner's Δr = 0.203 — while the card channel underneath
moved at 94.9× SE. Four worlds per corner; the projection's own MC
error (the disclosed 2.8% proxy discrepancy) is the standing
demonstration of how unreliable this n is. Leans and priors therefore
inherit into M1c UNCHANGED; the note exists so that, whichever cell
the main run lands in, the record shows the first whisper and that it
moved nothing.

**Route: fund the measured budget.** The diagnostic ladder puts the
sufficient budget at **192 worlds/cell** (widths 0.45033528452170346
under q 1.8528700746510731; 0.2531601642892628 under 1.0) = 3840
worlds ≈ 6× base — feasible on this machine. Weakening the bar or
dropping the hard truth would be bar-shopping; the budget is what the
gate measured, so the budget is what the leg pays. M1c below. The MC
caveat (n=64 re-draw 0.7859 vs gate 0.8083) drives M1c's projection
precision: B_proj = 2000 with a pre-declared 10000-draw boundary
re-run.

## M4-M1c — r-at-level at the measured budget

**REGISTERED 2026-08-11, BEFORE RUN.** Planner: this document's
author; executor: dispatched agent. Everything INHERITED VERBATIM from
M4-M1b (which inherits M4-M1): question, machinery, source objects,
grid share {0.10, 0.25, 0.40, 0.60} × φ {0.05, 0.30, 0.60, 0.85,
0.98}, both planner design tables (G0m′(vii) unchanged), forms
F1/F1e/F2/F3, optimizer pins, start grid, LOO-cell selection,
within-cell world-block bootstrap B = 2000 (20000 at rule-13
boundaries), tie rule, leans L-1 [.55] / L-2 [.55/.35/.10 conditional]
/ L-3 [.70] / L-4 (reading), truth-table cells 2–6 with modifiers, and
L-1's 0.60 bar. Exactly the following changes.

- **Worlds/cell: 192** (the budget M1b's diagnostic measured). Salt
  `m4m1c-world`, master_seed 20260811, world indices 0..191 per cell;
  3840 worlds total.
- **No new pilot.** G2m″: M1b's pilot artifacts are the pinned noise,
  regime and liveness source — same instrument, same corners; G0m″
  verifies σ_w = 0.026889438327132725 and the pilot pass records
  bit-exactly from `results/m4_m1b_r_at_level/`. A SMOKE stage
  (before the remaining worlds, after Part 0): generate world index 0
  for each of the 20 cells and check ONLY per-world
  finiteness/saturation booleans — no aggregation, no level is read
  (pinned; these 20 worlds are retained in the main sample); any
  failure → STOP (a mid-grid regime break is a planner-scale
  surprise; the ALT ladder is NOT available here since it would need
  a fresh projection).
- **G3m″ feasibility confirmation (Part 0, before any world):**
  recompute the projection from M1b's persisted σ_w at n = 192,
  B_proj = 2000, seed = master, both truths; PASS iff both widths ≤
  0.50. Boundary rule (rule 13): if either width lands in
  [0.47, 0.53], re-decide at B_proj = 10000. On FAIL: once-only
  escalation to n = 256 (5120 worlds; recompute; pass → main at 256,
  budget declared; fail → STOP as NON_PROJECTABLE_AT_CEILING, handed
  back).
- **G0m″ anchors:** M1's (i)–(vi) and M1b's (vii)–(viii) re-verified,
  PLUS bit-exact verification of every M1b number cited in the
  adjudication above against `results/m4_m1b_r_at_level/` (σ_w, the
  four gate widths, the ladder widths 0.45033528452170346 /
  0.2531601642892628, cell sd 0.004753426045853251, the pilot
  contrasts 0.20325550047558588 / −0.007269536568279722 with their
  SE multiples).
- **Stages:** part0 (incl. projection) 240 s; smoke 30 s; worlds in 5
  chunks of 4 cells × indices 1..191 (~480 s each; 7 chunks of 3
  cells at escalation); fit 420 s; finalize 60 s; the 2×
  stop-and-report convention applies. Target < 80 min wall.
- **Deliverables:** `scripts/run_suica_m4_m1c_r_at_level.py`;
  `results/m4_m1c_r_at_level/` (gitignored);
  `reports/SUICA_M4_M1C_R_AT_LEVEL_REPORT.md` (generated tables);
  outcome appended HERE; one `docs/CLAIMS_LEDGER.md` row
  (EXPLORATORY); exactly ONE commit
  `feat(m4-m): M1c — r-at-level at the measured budget — <SLUG>`,

### Outcome (appended 2026-08-11 by the executing agent; append-only)

**`LEVEL_RESPONSE_DISSOCIATION` — rule-16 cell 4 (L-1 HOLD, L-2 below),
modifier `KAPPA_FOURTH_APPEARANCE`.** Report:
`reports/SUICA_M4_M1C_R_AT_LEVEL_REPORT.md`; harness
`scripts/run_suica_m4_m1c_r_at_level.py`; artifacts `results/m4_m1c_r_at_level/`.
**3840 worlds** (20 cells x 192),
the budget M1b's own diagnostic measured and the planner funded.

**The exponent is identified at level, and it is not the response exponent.**
Winner **F1e** (`field = lambda*r^q - kappa*V - epsilon, epsilon in [0, 0.05]`): q = **`-0.15040108849226472`**, 95% CI
`[-0.18322395953281184, -0.11871900002844447]`, width `0.06450495950436737` against L-1's `0.6` bar —
**L-1 HOLDS with 9.3x room**. The interval lies **entirely below** the response
band `[1.71, 1.98]` and **entirely below zero**: L-2 = **below**, the
registered lean (BELOW, prior .55) called it, and cell 4's
`LEVEL_RESPONSE_DISSOCIATION` is the outcome. lambda = `0.2249206339499495` CI
`[0.2226976852269149, 0.2267740781729326]` **excludes zero**, which is what keeps this out of cell 2.
kappa = `0.7601952008701406` CI `[0.7356727662590873, 0.7846243216827854]` sits inside K2f's
`[0.5202855978239498, 0.8612166024267973]` — L-3 **overlap**, **kappa's FOURTH independent
appearance**, and the tightest interval yet recorded for it.

**The sign is the finding, and it is visible in the raw cell means before any
fit.** At EXACTLY fixed V = `0.18000000000000005` (share 0.6), moving phi
across the ladder drops predicted attenuation r from `0.6573448847694047` to
`0.4541409476972356` while the measured b-only field recovery RISES from
`0.05410832013119198` to `0.063796931786496` — a gain of
4.03363828257993 pooled SEM. Less predicted card attenuation, MORE field
recovery, person-variance held exactly constant. The exponent does not merely
differ between grades; it is opposite in sign.

**All four forms agree on the picture** (q negative and small, kappa ~0.76,
lambda ~0.18-0.22): LOO-RMSE {'F1': 0.003198131708377386, 'F1e': 0.0031856515917748638, 'F2': 0.0034019365713125944, 'F3': 0.003877604046883495}; in-sample RMSE {'F1': 0.0026264051166751978, 'F1e': 0.002621078709438027, 'F2': 0.002591249722764473, 'F3': 0.0033903747201612703}.
Per-cell SEM ranged `0.0015046764572937737`-`0.0020066026535869932`; cell mean field
`0.05410832013119198`-`0.16512469544098618`.

**Gates.** G0m'' PASS on all nine clauses — **39 numbered citation
checks bit-exact**, including (vii) the planner's design table, (viii) the
M1-STOP numbers against `results/m4_m1_r_at_level/`, and (ix) EVERY M1b number
this adjudication cites against `results/m4_m1b_r_at_level/` (sigma_w, the four
gate widths, the ladder pair, the cell sd, both pilot contrasts with their SE
multiples). G1m'' PASS. **G2m'' PASS with no new pilot** — M1b's persisted pilot
is the pinned regime/liveness/noise source, verified bit-exactly. **G3m''
CONFIRMED BEFORE ANY WORLD**: from M1b's persisted sigma_w = `0.026889438327132725`,
at n = 192 and B_proj = 2000, projected q widths
{'1.0': 0.24923889216646022, '1.8528700746510731': 0.46602037304504784} against the `0.5` bar; boundary rule fired
**False**, escalation fired **False**. M1b's
B_proj=500 ladder had said [0.45033528452170346, 0.2531601642892628] at the same configuration — the
honest re-run at 4x the draws agrees inside its own MC error. SMOKE PASS: world
0 of all 20 cells finite and non-saturated, booleans only, worlds retained.
G4m'' PASS. RN-M1C-1's inheritance proof passed against **both** predecessor
harnesses.

**Two independent signals say the registered form family does not span this
truth. Both are readings; neither moves the slug.** (i) **The winner's epsilon
is pinned at its declared upper bound**: `0.049999999999999996` against the bound
`0.05`, with a bootstrap interval `[0.049999999999909624, 0.049999999999999996]` whose LOWER
endpoint is `9.037909309839165e-14` from the bound — essentially every draw sat
on the constraint, so F1e contributes no effective free fourth parameter and is
F1 with a fixed offset and a re-scaled lambda. (ii) **Appendix W's
quadratic-in-r discriminator FIRES while L-4 stays quiet** — per-share
Spearman(residual, phi) = [0.0, 0.8999999999999998, 0.6, -0.6], reading A 2/4 and reading B
0/4 against a 3/4 bar (both False/False),
against an r^2 coefficient of `-0.19911194958208703` with CI `[-0.2879978718649799, -0.10706476050455438]`
excluding zero on the within-share fixed-effects reading (pooled
`-0.04921007645583713` `[-0.10592459329331352, 0.007421060164540356]` does not fire). W.1's own rule:
that configuration is **FORM_GAP evidence**, and the prescribed follow-up is a
registered form extension, NOT a phi-channel claim.

**An honest correction to appendix W.** W.1 predicted the span gap would appear
as a U-shape — "residuals positive at both r-extremes, negative mid-range" — a
POSITIVE r^2 coefficient. The measured coefficient is NEGATIVE: residuals low at
both r-extremes, high in the middle, an inverted U. The discriminator fires in
KIND exactly as W.1 specified and its prescription stands; the missing shape is
on the OPPOSITE side of the family's span from the "positive floor plus positive
power" W.1 hypothesised. The epsilon-at-bound finding points the same way
independently: the fit wants a MORE negative constant than the box allows, not a
positive floor.

**Tie rule and rule 13.** The tie rule FIRED: F1e beats
F1 by `1.2480116602522386e-05` = 0.39176024882147187% of the winner's LOO,
inside the 5% band, so every verdict had to agree across both forms — and every
verdict does, so nothing reports SPLIT. This matters more than usual here,
because F1 is UNBOUNDED and reaches the same three verdicts from
q = `-0.1888182542137735` CI `[-0.22686946646111852, -0.14900957557344477]`, kappa = `0.7596295789070726`, lambda =
`0.17505204234174737`: the negative-q, kappa~0.76 picture is not an artifact of a
clipped parameter. Rule 13 fired (True) on the near-tie and
the B=20000 re-run left every verdict unchanged (all stable:
True).

**What is settled that was not.** K2f could not separate an intercept from
lambda*r^q and reported q' straddling zero at `[-0.3792124136721057, 0.5313115708778163]` (width
`0.910523984549922`). M1c's interval is `[-0.18322395953281184, -0.11871900002844447]`, width `0.06450495950436737`,
and excludes zero. The r-term at level is present, small and NEGATIVE.

**What must not be claimed.** q = `-0.15040108849226472` is the best exponent within a
family the residuals demonstrate is too small — not the exponent of the world.
The claim is scoped to the tested grid (shares [0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.6], phi
[0.05, 0.3, 0.6, 0.85, 0.98], this instrument, this carrier), and phi at {0.05, 0.30,
0.60, 0.85} remains a regime extension beyond the exercised {0.90, 0.98}.

**Anomalies, with timing.** The hypothesis-relevant boundary is the `fit` stage;
Part 0, the smoke booleans and the world CSVs all precede any level being read
or aggregated, and every RN note was pinned in Part 0 before the first world.
**A-1/A-2 (before Part 0):** the M4-M1 environment reused verbatim (CPython
3.12.12 venv from `requirements-lock-main.txt`, numpy `2.4.4`,
pandas `3.0.2`, scipy `1.17.1`), and no `timeout(1)` on macOS so
each stage ran as its own foreground command. **A-3 (Part 0, before any
world):** the binding projected width landed just BELOW the `[0.47, 0.53]`
re-decide band, so the 10000-draw rule did not fire — disclosed because a
slightly noisier draw would have triggered it, and the call was made by the
registered rule rather than by preference. **A-4 (at the fit):** the form tie.
**A-5 (at the fit):** epsilon pinned at its bound. **A-6 (at finalize):**
appendix W's discriminator firing with the opposite sign to W.1's prediction.
**A-7:** no stage approached its 2x threshold — Part 0 `155.4262659549713` s
against 240 s, every world chunk inside its 480 s estimate.

**Registration-defect candidates: ONE, non-blocking.** The registration selects
by LOO across four forms, one of which has a BOUNDED parameter, and it does not
say what happens when a bounded form wins WITH ITS BOUND ACTIVE — whether the
boundary parameter's CI is interpretable, whether the form should be demoted to
its effective dimension, or whether the boundary is itself a reportable finding
(it is treated as one here). Nothing turned on it, because the tie rule
independently forced agreement with the unbounded F1. Flagged so a
successor can settle it in advance rather than in the report.

**For M2.** The winner's LOO-RMSE is `0.0031856515917748638`, so a +-2xLOO band is
+-`0.0063713031835497275`. Two cautions before registering the seal: sealing
F1e seals a form whose fourth parameter is a boundary artifact, and
sealing ANY of the four seals a family the residuals say is incomplete. Sealing
F1 — unbounded, 0.39176024882147187% behind, same verdicts — may be
the more honest object. That is a registration decision; the executor takes no
position beyond reporting that the two are statistically indistinguishable here.
M3 (the one-kappa question) is now materially better supplied: kappa's fourth
appearance arrives with the tightest interval in the record.

### Planner adjudication of M1c (2026-08-11, appended after the run) — THE EXPONENT IS MEASURED, ITS SIGN IS NEGATIVE, AND THE FAMILY IS CONVICTED

**LEVEL_RESPONSE_DISSOCIATION + KAPPA_FOURTH_APPEARANCE accepted.**
L-1 HOLD at width 0.06450495950436737 against a 0.60 bar — the
decollinearized factorial identified at the first attempt what two
corpora could not. L-2 BELOW — and not merely below the band:
**below zero** (winner F1e q = −0.15040108849226472
[−0.18322395953281184, −0.11871900002844447]; unbounded F1 agrees,
q = −0.1888182542137735 [−0.22686946646111852, −0.14900957557344477]).
The registered lean (.55 below) pays out, and the both-truth gate that
was hardest under the disfavored truth is what makes this payout
worth something. L-3 overlap: κ = 0.7601952008701406
[0.7356727662590873, 0.7846243216827854] — the tax's FOURTH
independent appearance (0.722 difference-fitted; ≈0.715 9-pair refit;
0.750 K2f level; 0.760 here). The substantive core, stated plainly:
**at exactly fixed V = 0.18, r falls 0.657 → 0.454 and the measured
field RISES 0.0541 → 0.0638 (4.03 pooled SEM) — the level law's
r-dependence has the OPPOSITE SIGN to the response-grade exponent.**

**The family is convicted by two independent readings.** (i) F1e's ε
sits ON its declared bound (CI collapsed to within 9.04e-14 of 0.05)
— the family wants more constant than the T4 species floor allows.
(ii) Appendix W's discriminator FIRED IN KIND WITH INVERTED SIGN:
within-share r² residual coefficient −0.19911194958208703
[−0.2879978718649799, −0.10706476050455438] with the Spearman probe
quiet (2/4, 0/4) — FORM_GAP, not φ-leak; but W.1 predicted a positive
U for the (c>0, q>0) corner and the world sits in the (c pressed,
q<0) corner. Appendix W's sign prediction was WRONG and the record
says so (theory appendix X.5); the prescription it attached (a
registered form extension, not a φ-channel claim) survives and is
executed as M1d below.

**Rule 26 (enacted, rule-13-style — paid for by M1c's non-blocking
candidate, on which nothing turned only because the tie rule forced
F1 agreement by luck):** when a bounded form wins selection with any
bound ACTIVE at its optimum, every verdict is co-adjudicated on its
unbounded relaxation (or nearest registered unbounded form);
disagreement reports SPLIT; bound-activity is itself a reported
finding, and the active-bound CI is flagged one-sided-by-construction.

**Theory consequence (dated, appendix X):** the response-grade band
q = 1.83 [1.71, 1.98] was measured on K2b's share-driven sweeps, where
r and V move in lockstep — no V-clean positive-exponent measurement
exists anywhere in the record. M1c's V-clean measurement is negative.
The re-attribution — **the "quadratic over-response" was mostly the
variance tax wearing r's clothes** — is recorded in appendix X with
its yield clause, and M1d carries the in-corpus demonstration
(the V-omitted shadow fit, pre-signed positive).

**The executor's M2 flag is answered by sequencing.** Cell 4's route
("M2 seals the measured law") STANDS; what M1d determines is WHICH
measured law is the sealable object — sealing F1e would seal a
boundary artifact and sealing an incomplete family would seal glue
(the D-open lesson). M1d is artifact-space (no new worlds), then M2
seals its winner at exterior configurations. Projection honesty note
carried: the binding width 0.46602037304504784 sat just below the
re-decide band and the registered rule decided — disclosed, correct.

## M4-M1d — the completion and the coordinate (artifact-space; the leg appendix W's discriminator prescribed)

**REGISTERED 2026-08-11, BEFORE RUN.** Planner: this document's
author; executor: dispatched agent. NO NEW WORLDS: the data are M1c's
persisted 3840-world corpus (`results/m4_m1c_r_at_level/`), the 20
cell means re-derived round-trip from the rawest per-world artifacts.
Optimizer pins, start-grid conventions, LOO-cell selection,
within-cell world-block bootstrap (B = 2000; 20000 at rule-13
boundaries), tie rule at 5%, and rule 26 are inherited/in force.

### Question

Two, sharp: (1) **Completion** — does one free intercept complete the
family (the exact gap appendix W.1 named)? (2) **Coordinate** — is
the level law's second argument r (card space) or φ (state dynamics)?
Within a share stratum r and φ are re-parametrizations; ACROSS shares
they differ exactly where r(share, ·) moves — the factorial can tell
them apart. The mechanism hypothesis being tested (named in appendix
X.4, not claimed): the deployed gauge is an occasion-structure
consumer, not a card consumer — slower state (higher φ) means more
coherent occasion blocks and a more readable person×frame
interaction, RAISING the field even as the card attenuates (K-R1's
scaffold finding and K2b's G4b supply the frame-carried substrate).

### Forms (six; the four incumbents frozen in their M1c roles, plus)

- **F0: field = c + λ·r^q − κ·V** — free intercept, ALL parameters
  unbounded (the W.1 gap made a form);
- **Fφ: field = c + a·φ^m − κ·V** — the coordinate alternative,
  unbounded; φ = the design φ of each cell.

Start grids (pinned): F0 — c ∈ {0, 0.05, 0.1}; λ ∈ {0.05,
0.17417497661611914, 0.5}; q ∈ {−1, −0.5, −0.15, 0, 0.5,
1.8528700746510731}; κ ∈ {0, 0.7220359963712748, 2.0} (162 starts).
Fφ — c ∈ {0, 0.05, 0.1}; a ∈ {0.01, 0.05, 0.15}; m ∈ {0.5, 1, 2, 4};
κ as F0 (108 starts). Nesting stated: F0 nests F1 at c = 0; Fφ nests
no incumbent. Selection: leave-one-CELL-out RMSE across all SIX
forms; bootstrap CIs for the winner(s); rule 26 co-adjudication
wherever a bound is active (none is declared for F0/Fφ).

### Leans (sides declared)

- **L-1d [.70]:** an extension (F0 or Fφ) beats ALL FOUR incumbents
  on LOO. One-sided.
- **L-2d [conditional on L-1d; .50/.50]:** Fφ vs F0 as LOO winner —
  the coordinate question; either answer re-types theory (X.4).
- **L-3d [.75]:** the winner's κ CI overlaps M1c's
  [0.7356727662590873, 0.7846243216827854] — the fifth appearance.
  Two-sided overlap.
- **L-4d (reading → routing):** the winner's within-share r²-residual
  CI contains 0 ⟹ the family is COMPLETE (routes M2); fires ⟹ M2 is
  DEFERRED (sealing an incomplete family is sealing glue).

### Readings (adjudicate nothing; both pre-signed)

- **The V-shadow demonstration:** fit field = λ·r^q with NO V term
  and NO intercept on M1c's own 20 cells. Pre-signed: q_shadow > 0 —
  omitting the tax flips the exponent's sign in-corpus, the
  re-attribution of the response-grade band made visible in one
  number. Report q_shadow with CI.
- **Legacy retrodiction:** the winner's plain RMSE on K2f's 26
  compiled rows (re-derived round-trip) vs the sealed form's
  0.11259090547752257 and K2f's refit LOO 0.0061559195350209.
  Scoped: same-instrument extrapolation across corpora, descriptive.

### Gates

- **G0d (bit-exact).** (i) Re-derive M1c's 20 cell means from the
  rawest persisted per-world artifacts; match the persisted means
  bit-exactly. (ii) Verify every M1c number quoted in the
  adjudication above against `results/m4_m1c_r_at_level/` at full
  precision (both q CIs, κ CI, λ CI, ε boundary gap, LOO values, tie
  margin 1.2480116602522386e-05, r² CIs, Spearman vector, field/SEM
  ranges, the share-.60 rise 0.05410832013119198 →
  0.063796931786496 and its 4.03-SEM multiple, projection widths).
  (iii) The theory-doc band [1.71, 1.98] quote unchanged. Any
  mismatch → STOP (citation defect).
- **G1d.** Six-form table with nesting statement written before any
  fit; rule-22 sides; rule-24 generated tables. No feasibility gate:
  no new worlds — the estimand is form comparison on existing data
  and LOO is its guard (rule 25 note recorded).
- **G3d.** Stage estimates: part0 120 s, fit 240 s, finalize 60 s;
  2× stop-and-report.

### Routing (rule 16 — every combination to exactly one outcome)

| # | condition | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | any G0d mismatch | **STOP** (citation defect; no fit) |
| 2 | incumbents stand AND winner r² quiet | **FAMILY_STANDS** — M2 seals the M1c pair (F1e+F1 co-sealed per rule 26) |
| 3 | incumbents stand AND r² fires | **INCOMPLETE_UNREPAIRED** — M2 deferred; M1e (shape study) named |
| 4 | F0 wins AND r² quiet | **COMPLETED_IN_R** — T4 keeps the r-coordinate with an intercept; M2 seals F0 |
| 5 | Fφ wins AND r² quiet | **COORDINATE_RETYPED_TO_PHI** — the level law's second argument is state dynamics, not card readability; M2 seals Fφ |
| 6 | an extension wins AND r² fires | **COMPLETED_BUT_INCOMPLETE** — M2 deferred; M1e named |
| — | F0/Fφ tie (<5% LOO) | **CO_WINNERS** — both sealed in M2 (multiple predictions inside one hashed file, K2f precedent); verdicts co-adjudicated, disagreements SPLIT |
| — | L-3d disjoint | modifier **TAX_SHIFT** → M3's charter |

### Outcome (appended 2026-08-11 by the executing agent; append-only)

**`COMPLETED_BUT_INCOMPLETE` — rule-16 cell 6** (an extension wins AND the r²
residual fires). L-1d **HOLD**, L-2d **F0**, L-3d **overlap**,
L-4d **fires**; modifier none. Report:
`reports/SUICA_M4_M1D_FORM_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`; harness
`scripts/run_suica_m4_m1d_form_completion.py`; artifacts
`results/m4_m1d_form_completion/`. **No new worlds**: M1c's persisted
3840-world corpus, its 20 cell means re-derived
round-trip and matched bit-exactly.

**G0d PASSES.** All 20 cell means AND SEMs re-derived from the rawest per-world
artifacts match M1c's persisted values bit-for-bit; 30 enumerated
adjudication citations, the Spearman vector, both L-4 readings, the share-.60
rise (full precision rounding to the adjudication's 2-dp quote) and the theory
band all verify. The four incumbents were PROVEN frozen in their M1c roles —
Part 0 imports the M1c harness and demands bit-exact agreement on every
parameter and SSE.

**L-1d HOLDS — the intercept is real.** `F0` (`field = c + lambda*r^q - kappa*V`) wins
leave-one-cell-out at **`0.0030682764618814033`** against the best incumbent
`F1e`'s `0.0031856515917748638` — a factor of
1.03825441786347. Full LOO ranking: {'F0': 0.0030682764618814033, 'F1': 0.003198131708377386, 'F1e': 0.0031856515917748638, 'F2': 0.0034019365713125944, 'F3': 0.003877604046883495, 'Fphi': 0.0032498223469787663}. In-sample RMSE:
{'F0': 0.0025054232543959215, 'F1': 0.0026264051166751978, 'F1e': 0.002621078709438027, 'F2': 0.002591249722764473, 'F3': 0.0033903747201612703, 'Fphi': 0.002538699623241356}. Appendix W.1 named the gap; one free intercept closes most of
it.

**L-2d answers `F0` — the coordinate is r, not φ.** `Fφ` does not merely lose to
`F0` (`0.0032498223469787663` vs `0.0030682764618814033`), it loses to the best incumbent as
well. Appendix X.4's occasion-structure hypothesis — the gauge as a consumer of
state dynamics rather than card readability — gets **no support** from this
corpus. **But the call is close and must not be over-quoted:** the two separate
by `0.000181545885097363` = 5.916868553169516% of the smaller LOO against a
5.0% CO_WINNERS bar — 0.92 percentage
points outside it. Under 5% this leg would have sealed both coordinates. `Fφ` is
outperformed, not refuted.

**L-3d overlap — κ's FIFTH appearance.** `0.7766770259880144`, CI `[0.7482226203832176, 0.8064115044591174]`,
overlapping M1c's `[0.7356727662590873, 0.7846243216827854]`; no TAX_SHIFT. At width
`0.05818888407589973` it is the ONLY sharply identified parameter in the winning
form — which is the next paragraph's subject.

**THE FINDING THE REGISTRATION DID NOT ASK FOR: the winning form cannot report
an exponent.** `F0`'s intercept buys its LOO win by trading against the power
term, and the three are jointly non-identified: `c` CI `[0.20818746052333, 1.6803368132111625]` (width
`1.4721493526878324`), `λ` CI `[-1.5059828481846496, -0.04256154549067277]` (width `1.4634213026939769`),
`q` CI `[0.021913588793404413, 2.6445200496694605]` — **width `2.622606460876056`**. And the point
estimates arrive from the opposite corner to M1c's: `λ = -0.055190882521519`
(NEGATIVE) with `q = 1.372031438858951` (POSITIVE) describes the SAME falling-in-r
field that M1c described as `q = -0.15040108849226472` with positive λ. **M1c's negative
exponent was the family's only way to bend the field downward in r without an
intercept.** Given the intercept, it re-parameterises. The monotone direction is
robust across every form tried; the exponent is not a structural constant of
this world, it is a coordinate on a ridge. **M1c's `q = -0.15040108849226472`
`[-0.18322395953281184, -0.11871900002844447]` should be re-scoped in the record accordingly** — the
`LEVEL_RESPONSE_DISSOCIATION` verdict survives, because it rests on the SIGN of
the r-dependence and on the V-shadow contrast, not on the exponent's value.

**L-4d FIRES — M2 is deferred, M1e is named.** Within-share r² residual
`-0.12563681892698172`, CI `[-0.1772060912696028, -0.07219090437007022]`, excluding zero and stable at B = 20000
(`[-0.17935555262608965, -0.07097803090981235]`, stable True). The intercept shrank it
36.90141692114467% from M1c's `-0.19911194958208703` — real progress, not closure.
Two concrete inputs for M1e: the leftover curvature is **within-share only**
(pooled r² quiet at `0.001054754288525179` `[-0.010339263255536255, 0.014815973510193174]`), and it survived
the intercept at reduced amplitude, so the missing term is a within-stratum
shape in r rather than a between-share effect. The φ² companion
(`-0.012377098889152529` `[-0.021250484030500706, -0.0035455613757951142]`, executor-added, routes nothing) also fires and
carries NO coordinate information: within a stratum r and φ are monotone
re-parametrisations, so curvature in one implies curvature in the other — the
coordinate question is settled across shares, which is what the F0/Fφ LOO
comparison does.

**Reading 1, the V-shadow — pre-signed positive, and decisively so.** Fitting
`field = λ·r^q` on M1c's own 20 cells with NO tax and NO intercept returns
**q_shadow = `2.24488769944643`**, CI `[2.1768337883424214, 2.318980336007031]` — positive, confirmed
(True), and *above* the response band [1.71, 1.98] on the high
side. The winner's own exponent on the same cells is `1.372031438858951`. Omit the
variance tax and the same data produce a large positive exponent: the
re-attribution recorded in appendix X, demonstrated in-corpus in one number. The
shadow fits badly on its own terms (RMSE `0.02157946817434354` against the
winner's `0.0025054232543959215`) — a demonstration, not a rival.

**Reading 2, the legacy retrodiction — and it beats K2f's own refit.** The
winner, with NO refit, predicts K2f's 26 legacy compiled rows at RMSE
`0.0059526106645589934` against the sealed T4 composite's `0.11259090547752257`
— a factor of **18.914542176909535**. It also comes in BELOW K2f's own refit LOO
of `0.0061559195350209` (True), which is the
stronger statement: parameters estimated on a decollinearized factorial transfer
to a different corpus on a different design, unadjusted, and beat what that
corpus achieved by fitting itself. Per-form: {'F0': 0.0059526106645589934, 'F1': 0.0056954308382002605, 'F1e': 0.005699989746733798, 'F2': 0.005604357102432524, 'F3': 0.006428578997454841, 'Fphi': 0.006280786394748213}. Scoped as
registered — same-instrument extrapolation across corpora, descriptive.

**Rule 26 fired on its first opportunity, exactly as enacted.** `F1e`
reaches the bootstrap set as runner-up with its ε bound ACTIVE, so its unbounded
relaxation F1 was co-adjudicated AUTOMATICALLY rather than by the tie rule's
luck — the failure mode M1c's non-blocking candidate flagged. F0 and Fφ carry no
declared bounds; the numerical-limit test (RN-M1D-5: |param| >= 1e3 or
termination at max_nfev) was checked on every bootstrapped form and did not fire
(largest |parameter| `1.372031438858951`). **Tie rule** also fired
(`0.00011737512989346043` = 3.8254417863469983% between F0 and F1e); every
verdict agrees across the pair — L-3d overlap under both, and L-4d fires under
both (M1c measured F1e's own within-share r² at `-0.19911194958208703`
`[-0.2879978718649799, -0.10706476050455438]` under the same estimator) — so nothing reports SPLIT and the
routing is unchanged whichever member is read. **Rule 13** triggered on both
proximities; the B = 20000 re-run left L-3d and L-4d unchanged.

**Anomalies, with timing.** No worlds were drawn, so the hypothesis-relevant
boundary is the `fit` stage and Part 0 is pure verification of published
numbers; every RN note was pinned there. **A-1/A-2 (before Part 0):** the
inherited CPython 3.12.12 environment from `requirements-lock-main.txt`
(numpy `2.4.4`, pandas `3.0.2`, scipy `1.17.1`), and no
`timeout(1)` on macOS so each stage ran as its own foreground command. **A-3 (at
the fit):** the winner's joint non-identification — the headline caveat above,
found when its bootstrap CIs were first read; it changes no verdict because
L-4d defers M2 on independent grounds. **A-4 (at the fit):** the CO_WINNERS call
landing 0.92 points outside its bar. **A-5 (at the fit):**
rule 26 firing on its first opportunity — recorded because a rule enacted one leg
earlier changed this leg's bootstrap set automatically. **A-6:** no stage near
its 2× threshold (Part 0 `1.1947739124298096` s against 120 s).

**Registration-defect candidate: ONE, non-blocking, and it is the same shape as
the ones that bought rules 25 and 26.** Cells 4 and 5 route a winning extension
straight to "M2 seals F0 / seals Fφ" **with no identification requirement on the
sealed parameters**. Had the r² probe come back quiet, this leg would have
routed to `COMPLETED_IN_R` and handed M2 a form whose exponent interval is
`[0.021913588793404413, 2.6445200496694605]` — a seal on a ridge. Nothing turned on it because L-4d fired
independently. But the routing selects on predictive accuracy (LOO) while the
downstream consumer (a prospective seal) needs identified parameters, and those
are different properties — a gate that does not check what its consumer
requires. A successor should either add an identification clause to the sealing
cells or state explicitly that a seal may issue on a non-identified
parameterisation.

**Line state.** M2 deferred pending M1e. M3 is the best-supplied question in the
line: κ now has five independent appearances and is the only sharply identified
parameter in the winning form.

### Planner adjudication of M1d (2026-08-11, appended after the run) — THE EXPONENT DISSOLVES INTO A SLOPE; THE SHAPE QUESTION REPLACES THE COORDINATE QUESTION

**COMPLETED_BUT_INCOMPLETE accepted.** L-1d HOLD (F0 beats all four
incumbents; LOO 0.0030682764618814033), L-2d = F0 (Fφ loses even to
the incumbents — the naive state-dynamics representation is NOT the
better cross-share account), L-3d overlap (κ fifth appearance,
0.7766770259880144 [0.7482226203832176, 0.8064115044591174] — "the
only sharply identified parameter", the executor's words, correct),
L-4d FIRES (within-share r² = −0.12563681892698172
[−0.1772060912696028, −0.07219090437007022], stable at B = 20000) →
**M2 stays deferred; M1e is chartered below.**

**The scientific correction this leg forces (theory appendix Y).**
F0's (c, λ, q) are JOINTLY NON-IDENTIFIED — q [0.021913588793404413,
2.6445200496694605], λ entirely negative, c wide — and λ<0 with q>0
describes the SAME falling-in-r field that M1c's F1 described as λ>0,
q<0. **M1c's "negative exponent" was a parameterisation artifact of
the missing constant.** What survives, parameterisation-free: the
SIGN OF THE SLOPE — ∂field/∂r < 0 at fixed V (the model-free 4.03-SEM
contrast; both parameterisations agree). The DISSOCIATION verdict
stands (it was slope-sign vs the response attribution); the exponent
VALUE is withdrawn as a structural claim by dated note. The
level-law's identified content on this corpus is: a level constant, a
weak negative r-slope, and the tax.

**What strengthened.** (i) The V-shadow demonstration confirmed its
pre-signed flip: q_shadow = 2.24488769944643 [2.1768337883424214,
2.318980336007031] — omit the tax and the exponent snaps positive,
ABOVE the response band; appendix X.2's re-attribution now has its
one-number in-corpus proof. (ii) Legacy transfer: with NO refit, F0
retrodicts K2f's 26 rows at 0.0059526106645589934 — 18.91× better
than the sealed form and below K2f's own refit LOO; every M1d form
lands 0.0056–0.0064 — the constant-minus-tax-with-weak-negative-slope
structure is CROSS-CORPUS. (iii) Rule 26 fired on its first
opportunity, automatically. (iv) The five κ routes now read 0.715 /
0.722 / 0.750 / 0.760 / 0.777 — chainwise-overlapping with a mild
upward drift in level-space routes; recorded UNADJUDICATED as M3's
opening observation.

**Defect #45 (mine; rule 27 enacted).** M1d's cells 4/5 routed a
winning extension straight to "M2 seals it" with NO identification
requirement on the sealed parameters — had r² come back quiet, M2
would have been handed a ridge (q width 2.62). Same genus as the
defects behind rules 25/26: selection by LOO, consumption requiring
identification. **Rule 27:** a route that hands a fitted object to a
downstream consumer (a seal, an adoption, a cross-leg comparison)
carries an explicit identification budget on every parameter the
consumer will quote; selection wins (LOO or otherwise) alone never
qualify an object for consumption.

## M4-M1e — the shape: additive or r-mediated (artifact-space)

**REGISTERED 2026-08-11, BEFORE RUN.** Planner: this document's
author; executor: dispatched agent. NO NEW WORLDS: M1c's persisted
corpus, the 20 cell means re-derived bit-exactly. Optimizer pins,
LOO-cell selection, bootstrap B = 2000/20000, tie rule 5%, rules
26/27 in force.

### Question

Does the level field SEPARATE — field(share, φ) = share-margin +
φ-margin — or does the r-channel carry the cross-structure? These are
distinguishable HERE because r(share, φ) is strongly non-additive:
the within-share r-spans run 0.04714885082631204 →
0.20320393707216905 (4.31× by share), so any r-mediated field with a
material r-coefficient must show share×φ interaction, while a truly
additive field kills r-mediation. If additivity wins with the share
margin linear in V, the level law's arguments are (V, φ) as SEPARATE
channels — the tax channel and a state-dynamics channel — and card
readability was never an argument, only a correlate.

### Part 0 (before any fit)

- **G0e.** (i) Re-derive the 20 cell means bit-exactly. (ii) Verify
  every M1d number quoted in the adjudication above at full precision
  against `results/m4_m1d_form_completion/` (F0 params and all three
  CIs, LOO table, tie margins 0.00011737512989346043 and the 5.92%
  Fφ separation, κ CI, r² CIs at both B, q_shadow triple, legacy
  retrodiction values). (iii) Quote-check [1.71, 1.98] unchanged.
  Mismatch → STOP.
- **Model-free monotonicity table (Part-0 object, before fits):** the
  four within-share extreme contrasts field(φ=.98) − field(φ=.05)
  with pooled SEs — the parameterisation-free record of the slope
  sign per share.

### Models (five; pinned)

- **E-add:** field = α_s + g_φ (free margins, sum-to-zero pinning
  stated; 8 identifiable params);
- **E-tax-add:** field = c − κ·V + g_φ (share margin forced through
  the tax; 7 params);
- **E-rlin:** field = α_s + s·r (5);
- **E-rq:** field = α_s + λ·r^q (6; starts: λ ∈ {−0.5, −0.055, 0.05,
  0.5}, q ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 1.372031438858951, 2.0, 3.0});
- **F0 (frozen incumbent):** M1d's winner as the baseline to beat.

### Leans (sides declared, rule 22)

- **L-1e [.45]:** an additive form (E-add or E-tax-add) wins LOO
  outright over all r-mediated forms AND F0. Complement: r-mediated
  wins [.35]; F0 stands [.20].
- **L-2e [.60]:** the share margin is the tax — E-tax-add within 5%
  LOO of E-add AND its κ CI overlaps M1d's [0.7482226203832176,
  0.8064115044591174] (the sixth appearance).
- **L-3e (reading → routing):** the winner's within-share r²-probe —
  quiet ⟹ SHAPE settled; fires ⟹ shape remains open.

### Rule-27 identification budgets (for any object routed to M2)

κ width ≤ 0.15; c width ≤ 0.05; each g_φ point width ≤ 0.01; s width
≤ 50% of |point|; E-rq's (λ, q) jointly: q width ≤ 1.0. An object
missing its budget is NOT sealable regardless of routing.

### Routing (rule 16)

| # | condition | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | any G0e mismatch | **STOP** (citation defect) |
| 2 | additive wins AND winner's probe quiet AND budgets met | **ADDITIVE_SHAPE_SETTLED** — r-mediation dead at level on this family; the arguments are (V, φ); M2 seals the winner at exterior-share × interior-φ cells (a pinned-form φ-extrapolation may ride as a SECONDARY sealed prediction) |
| 3 | r-mediated wins AND probe quiet AND budgets met | **R_MEDIATED_SETTLED** — M2 seals it |
| 4 | F0 stands (nothing beats it) | **NO_BETTER_SHAPE** — the M1-series closes at its measured limit: identified = level band + negative slope + tax; shape = named open; M2 re-charters on the SCOPED object (κ-channel + model-free cell predictions), not on a shape |
| 5 | any winner AND probe fires | **SHAPE_OPEN_NAMED** — same scoped-M2 route as cell 4 |
| 6 | routing would seal but budgets unmet | **IDENTIFIED_INSUFFICIENTLY** — scoped-M2 route |
| — | L-2e κ disjoint | modifier **TAX_SHIFT** → M3 |

Tie (<5% LOO) between an additive and an r-mediated form:
**REPRESENTATION_TIE** — both reported, verdicts co-adjudicated,
disagreement SPLIT; routing takes the SCOPED route (a tie on
representation is not a settled shape).

### Deliverables and budget

`scripts/run_suica_m4_m1e_shape.py`; `results/m4_m1e_shape/`
(gitignored); `reports/SUICA_M4_M1E_SHAPE_REPORT.md` (generated
tables); outcome append HERE; one ledger row (EXPLORATORY); exactly
ONE commit `feat(m4-m): M1e — the shape — <SLUG>`, never amended,
never pushed; suite green first. Artifact-space: target < 10 min,
stages < 600 s.
