# SUICA M4-Q — The Transport Line

Line opened 2026-08-14, on the P-line's close. Question: **what
survives frame refreshment?** The P-line proved the deployed
relation-field gauge reads frame-agreement (appendix II: gradient
~88% frame-owned, cross-frame levels near zero, injected boost
96–97% frame-vs-frame). Appendix N's instrument-role typing says
cards dominate the gauge ~4.5× at trait reading. The missing
mechanism half: **do CARD readings transport across frames?** If
cards transport where the gauge does not, the taxonomy completes —
cards read persons, the gauge reads frames — with both halves
measured by ONE device (P3b's certified split-seed instrument). If
cards are frame-locked too, K-R1's scaffold universality
("person content has no frame-free expression in this family")
extends from the field to the card layer — a deeper claim either
way.

Tier: EXPLORATORY, label-free, synthetic. The ledger controls.
Registrations before run, append-only. Standing rules 1–32 bind;
ALL conventions in force, including the P-line's four (#55
NULL-first classifications; #56 inheritance is not exemption; #57
pilot correlations never consumed — projections/bands use
independence with a stated margin, df-inflation licenses variances
only; #58 pivots carry sub-cases). Execution conventions as the
M/N/P lines (ONE commit per leg `feat(m4-q): ...`, never amended,
never pushed; chunked foreground stages < 600 s; `suica_core/`, k2b
and the P3b instrument READ-ONLY — Q-legs import the instrument by
file with provenance).

## Line charter

- **Q1 — card transport under frame refreshment** (registered
  below).
- **Q2 — the tax under refreshment** (named): does the tax curve
  κ(V) survive frame-fixed scoring? Register only after Q1.
- **Q3 — reader-side vs generator-side refreshment on one design**
  (named): the two T9 layers compared head-to-head.

## M4-Q1 — card transport under frame refreshment

**REGISTERED 2026-08-14, BEFORE RUN.** Planner: this document's
author; executor: dispatched agent. No seal (bounded classifications,
split leans).

### Question and device

Same A/B paired worlds as P3c (P3b's certified instrument, imported
by file with provenance; C2 battery re-run on 4 fresh probes; C1′
anchor on R_nat as instrument certificate). NEW quantities at the
CARD layer: per world-pair,

- **C_nat** — the published card-level b-recovery statistic of the
  A-world (cards from A scored against A's b-truth in card space);
- **C_ref** — A's cards scored against B's b-truth cards (same
  persons, fresh frame; author-indexed card vectors, cosine per
  author, mean — the card-layer analogue of R_refresh).

**Rule-12 delegation with decision rule:** the card statistic is
THE published card-level b-recovery used in K-R1's instrument-role
comparison (the ~4.5× vs the gauge; appendix N) — the executor pins
its source object file:line in Part 0 and reuses it verbatim for
C_nat; C_ref replaces only the truth-side card panel with the
B-world's, everything else identical. If the published statistic is
not expressible as author-indexed card vectors admitting
cross-world scoring, STOP as INEXPRESSIBLE (an instrument finding).

### Design

share 0.25 × φ ∈ {0.05, 0.98} × 384 A/B pairs each (768 pairs,
1536 worlds; the gauge quantities R_nat/R_refresh are ALSO computed
on the same pairs as a free within-leg replication of P3c's
levels). Salts `m4q1-author` / `m4q1-frameA` / `m4q1-frameB` /
`m4q1-pilot`, master_seed 20260814.

### Part 0

- **G0q1 (bit-exact).** (i) P3c's endpoint dual table and D_grad /
  range_ref values verified against `results/m4_p3c_transportable_gradient/`;
  (ii) the K-R1 4.5× comparison's numbers located at source (the
  card attenuation 0.827-family values; quote verbatim, rule 24);
  (iii) instrument hashes match P3b's persisted function/file
  sha256s. Mismatch → STOP.
- **G1q1 (rule 10).** (a) C2 battery re-run PASS; (b) the C_ref
  operator's zero-point identity: scoring A's cards against A's own
  truth cards through the C_ref code path reproduces C_nat
  bit-exactly; (c) at s… (no injection in this leg — clause (c) is
  the A/B frame-difference proof, inherited).
- **G2q1 (pilot).** 4 pairs × both φ; rule-29 predicate on C_nat,
  C_ref (domain: card cosines in [−1, 1], null 0, saturation
  |·| ≥ 0.995); equivalence bands ε_C (for C_ref vs 0) and ε_L
  (for the transport loss) computed df-inflated, VARIANCES ONLY
  (#57: independence with margin 1.25 on any covariance-dependent
  SE, stated).
- **G3q1 (rule 25).** Projection (B_proj = 2000) at truths
  {CARDS_TRANSPORT: C_ref = C_nat_pilot; CARDS_FRAME_LOCKED:
  C_ref = 0}: PASS iff both classifications reached at ≥ 0.8 power
  with ≤ 0.1 false-fire at 384 pairs/φ; once-only escalation to 768
  ON THIS GATE; else NON_PROJECTABLE.
- **G4q1.** Routing verified disjoint-and-covering,
  consequence-entailed, NULL-first; rule 24; stages: part0 150 s,
  pilot 60 s, worlds 4 chunks (~230 s), score+fit 180 s, finalize
  60 s; target < 40 min.

### Verdicts (rule 22; NULL-first)

Per φ and pooled: **V-Qa** C_ref vs 0 (NULL inside ±ε_C / POSITIVE
/ NEGATIVE / UNDERPOWERED); **V-Qb** the transport loss L_C =
C_nat − C_ref vs 0 (same classes, band ε_L). The card transport
share C_ref/C_nat is quoted ONLY as UNBUDGETED descriptive with its
CI (the P3b lesson). The gauge-side replication (R_refresh levels
vs P3c) is a reading, no gate.

### Leans (sides declared)

**L-1q1 [CARDS_TRANSPORT_SUBSTANTIAL (V-Qa POSITIVE with C_ref ≥
half of C_nat, descriptive) .40 / CARDS_PARTIAL (V-Qa POSITIVE,
smaller) .35 / CARDS_FRAME_LOCKED (V-Qa NULL) .15 / other .10]** —
the theory expects cards to carry b directly (post-map deviation
objects), but the P3c shock (gauge levels ≈ 0 cross-frame) tempers
confidence; K-R1's "no frame-free expression" could extend to the
card layer.

### Routing (rule 16 — disjoint, covering, consequences entailed)

| 5 | V-Qa POSITIVE and V-Qb POSITIVE | **CARDS_TRANSPORT_PARTIAL** — real transport, real loss; both quantified (loss share descriptive) |
| 6 | V-Qa NULL | **CARDS_FRAME_LOCKED** — the scaffold universality extends to the card layer; appendix N's 4.5× re-reads as within-frame only; major theory note |

### M4-Q1 outcome (appended after execution; registration above unedited)

**INEXPRESSIBLE — routing cell 1; modifiers: none.**
STOP / INEXPRESSIBLE. Stopped at the registration's own expressibility clause, answered by code in Part 0 + the demonstration. **0 measurement
pairs drawn** (16 demonstration pairs on the pilot salt). Harness
`scripts/run_suica_m4_q1_card_transport.py`; report
`reports/SUICA_M4_Q1_CARD_TRANSPORT_REPORT.md`; artifacts
`results/m4_q1_card_transport/` (gitignored).

**THE CARD LAYER'S b-TRUTH IS FRAME-FREE BY CONSTRUCTION, SO TRUTH-SIDE FRAME
REFRESHMENT IS A NULL OPERATION THERE.** The registration's own expressibility
clause is the right exit, and it was reached by code rather than by argument.

**The statistic has two readings and the registration does not disambiguate
(RN-Q1-1).** Appendix N says "card attenuation 0.827 vs field recovery 0.178",
and two persisted objects round to 0.827: the CLOSED-FORM prediction
`r_card_b_pred_raw` = 0.8271784593117322 (`scripts/run_suica_m4_k2b_t4_branch.py:533`, `arm_predictions`) and
the MEASURED pooled `r_card_b_raw` = 0.8266850143926395
(`scripts/run_suica_m4_k2b_t4_branch.py:392-457` → `pooled_card_stats`). The companion 0.178
(0.177888649457317) is measured, which favours the second; the digits favour
the first. **Both were pinned and both carried through the expressibility test,
because the STOP has a different route under each.**

- **Reading A (closed form): INEXPRESSIBLE flatly.** `arm_predictions` is pure
  algebra over retained cell sizes and four variance shares. It takes no world,
  touches no author, forms no vector, and **has no truth side to replace**.
- **Reading B (measured): expressible, but the estimand is degenerate.** The
  64-dim per-author vectors do exist inside `card_channel_frame` (the card
  `full` and the truth `trait`), contracted row-wise — so a cross-world path is
  constructible, and it was built and **proven bit-exact against k2b**
  (G1q1(b) = True on 16 checks: the path reproduces k2b's own
  frame byte-for-byte and its pooled statistic exactly when both arguments are
  A). But its truth side is `world['trait']` — a pure AUTHOR-stream object.

**Both readings agree on the STOP.**

**The registration's phrase names an object that does not exist (RN-Q1-2).**
"C_ref replaces only the truth-side card panel" presupposes the truth side is a
card panel. It is not: the estimate side is a card (a centred channel mixture
with the frame channel excluded by construction, k2b:422-428) while the truth
side is world['trait'][idx], scripts/run_suica_m4_k2b_t4_branch.py:410 -- the BARE LATENT TRAIT ARRAY, not a card. The harness replaced exactly the object that can be
replaced and reported the mismatch. The trap was avoided explicitly (RN-Q1-3):
`trait_c` feeds BOTH the card and the centred truth, so swapping the world
wholesale would have produced a B-world replication rather than a cross-world
score; only the truth-side trait was parameterised.

**The result: C_ref ≡ C_nat, identically.** Not "within noise" — to the last
bit, on every pair at both φ (True, max |L_C| = 0.0). A
and B share the author seed by construction — which is precisely what C2a
certifies — so B's trait is bit-identical to A's (True) and
swapping the truth side changes nothing.

**The contrast that makes the finding sharp** — same pairs, same device:

| φ | n | C_nat | C_ref | L_C | R_nat | R_refresh | R_nat − R_refresh |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.05 | 8 | 0.7846736299843141 | 0.7846736299843141 | 0.0 | 0.11439067415413948 | 0.0009056149726381045 | 0.1134850591815014 |
| 0.98 | 8 | 0.6763296428445553 | 0.6763296428445553 | 0.0 | 0.1362886208874512 | -0.007950204144913695 | 0.14423882503236488 |

The gauge's b-only truth is `emit_panel(..., active=("mu","common"))` — it
**contains the frame** — so B's truth panel genuinely differs
(True) and R_refresh moves away from R_nat by 0.12886194210693314 on
average, replicating P3c's near-zero cross-frame levels as a free within-leg
reading. **The two layers differ precisely in whether their truth object
carries the frame.**

**What this does to appendix N's ~4.5×.** The gap is not a contest between two
readers of one target: the card statistic's target is the person (trait), while
the gauge's b-only target is person PLUS frame. The Q-line's question therefore
cannot be answered by refreshing the truth side — at the card layer there is no
frame in the truth to refresh. The taxonomy the line set out to complete is
settled by what each layer's truth object CONTAINS, by inspection plus proof
rather than by measurement. (Ratio note, rule 30: the persisted operands give
4.6499788594449205 and 4.6472049617252065; appendix N's "~4.5×" carries a
tilde and no artifact holds a ratio key — the number is prose, not a computed
object.)

**Why the STOP rather than the routing.** Had the leg proceeded, V-Qa would have
read POSITIVE (C_ref ≈ 0.78/0.68, far from 0) and V-Qb NULL (L_C ≡ 0), firing
**cell 4 CARDS_TRANSPORT_FULL** and publishing "card reading crosses frames
without measurable loss" as a MEASUREMENT. It is an identity. Cell 4's
consequence is not entailed by an identity (#46/#54), so the expressibility STOP
is the correct exit and the only honest one.

**A measurable neighbour, NAMED NOT RUN.** Swapping the ESTIMATE side instead —
scoring B's cards against the shared trait and comparing to A's — is a
frame-sensitivity reading of the card estimate, which does differ (slow, noise
and int are frame-stream objects). That is a DIFFERENT estimand from the
registered truth-side swap; the executor does not substitute estimands. The
demonstration's per-φ C_nat spread across A-worlds is the within-frame
variability such a reading would formalise.

**Gates.** G0q1 PASS — P3c's values, the 4.5× operands bit-exact at source, and
the instrument hashes matching P3b's persisted sha256s (True /
True). C2 PASS on 4 fresh probe pairs. G1q1(b) PASS.
G2q1/G3q1/C1′ not reached — the expressibility clause fires first.

**Rule events.** Rule 13/25/27: not reached. Rule 26: no bounded winner. Rule
29: the predicate was defined for the card cosines and not exercised. Rule 30:
every cited constant read from its persisted source; the card statistic carries
two source pins and both candidate values.

**Executor self-report.** Two standing anomalies, both resolved before any
number existed: A-1 the dispatched interpreter is absent (a pinned CPython
3.12.12 venv built from the lockfile); A-2 `timeout(1)` is absent on macOS
(foreground stages under explicit sub-600 s timeouts). No hypothesis-relevant
number was ever computed — the leg stopped before its first measurement arm and
the demonstration quantities are identities.

**Registration-defect candidates (2).** (1) **The estimand was degenerate at
registration time and the degeneracy was computable from persisted sources**:
the card statistic's truth side is `world['trait']` (k2b:410) and P3b's own
certified channel taxonomy places `trait` in the AUTHOR stream — the two facts
sit in the repo and their conjunction forces C_ref ≡ C_nat before any world is
drawn. This is the #43/#44/#51/#53/#56 genus once more, now at the level of an
estimand's *definition* rather than its precision. (2) **Routing cell 4's
consequence is not entailed under the degenerate case**: the cell would have
fired on an identity and published it as a measurement. The #46/#54 mechanical
check verifies disjointness and covering; it does not verify that a cell's
antecedent can only be reached by measurement. The convention worth adding is
that a routing cell whose antecedent is satisfiable by construction must be
guarded by a non-degeneracy clause — the card-layer analogue of rule 10.

### Planner adjudication of Q1 (2026-08-14, appended after the run) — THE DEGENERACY IS THE DISCOVERY; INSTRUMENT COMPARISONS GET A LICENSE RULE

**INEXPRESSIBLE accepted — and the stop is the leg's finding.** The
card statistic's truth side is `world["trait"]` (k2b:410), a pure
AUTHOR-stream object; A and B share the author stream bit-identically
(exactly what C2a certifies), so C_ref ≡ C_nat with max |L_C| = 0.0
EXACTLY — an identity, not a measurement. The executor proved the
cross-world path byte-for-byte against k2b before showing it
degenerate (the zero-point identity), disambiguated appendix N's
0.827 into its two persisted objects (predicted 0.8271784593117322,
measured 0.8266850143926395; realized ratios 4.6500/4.6472 against
the prose "~4.5×"), and delivered a free THIRD replication of the
gauge collapse on the same pairs (R_refresh ≈ 0, mean gap
0.12886194210693314).

**The conceptual result (appendix JJ):** the card layer and the
gauge layer differ precisely in whether their TRUTH OBJECT carries
the frame — the card's target is frame-free by construction, the
gauge's target (mu + common) is frame-carrying. **Appendix N's 4.5×
therefore compares readers of DIFFERENT TARGETS, not two readers of
one.** Rule 33 (enacted): **an instrument comparison ("X× better")
is licensed only between readers of the SAME registered target
object; readers of different targets are typed as different
INSTRUMENTS and are never ranked.** Appendix N's typing survives
with its comparison re-scoped by dated note.

**Defect #59 (mine — the #43 genus at the level of an estimand's
DEFINITION).** The degeneracy was computable at registration from
two facts already persisted (truth = trait, k2b:410; trait ∈ author
stream, P3b's certified taxonomy). Convention extended (rule-10
family + #46/#54 mechanical check): **non-degeneracy proofs cover
the estimand's defining contrast — the object swapped or varied must
provably DIFFER under the swap — verified at registration where the
facts are persisted, and in Part 0 otherwise; a routing cell whose
antecedent is satisfiable by construction is a defect.** RN-Q1-2
(the registration's phrase "truth-side card panel" named a
nonexistent object) noted, mine.

**The properly-posed question (Q1b, below).** The executor's
named-not-run estimate-side swap is HALF right: C_B vs C_A is
degenerate by exchangeability (A and B are iid given the author
stream). The non-degenerate, theory-central quantity is the
CROSS-FRAME CARD COSINE cos(card_A, card_B) against the
disattenuation identity r̂_A·r̂_B — because A and B share ONLY the
author stream (certified), any excess of cos(A,B) over the
trait-predicted product is AUTHOR-STREAM CONTENT BEYOND THE TRAIT
carried by the cards. That is the identity question itself, at card
level: **does the card carry the person's ID beyond their
biography?**

---

## M4-Q1b — the cross-frame card cosine (identity beyond the trait)

**REGISTERED 2026-08-14, BEFORE RUN.** Planner: this document's
author; executor: dispatched agent. Device: P3b's certified
instrument (import by file, hashes verified; C2 battery on 4 fresh
probes). Design: share 0.25 × φ ∈ {0.05, 0.98} × 384 A/B pairs
(768 pairs, 1536 worlds); salts `m4q1b-author` / `m4q1b-frameA` /
`m4q1b-frameB` / `m4q1b-pilot`, master_seed 20260814.

### Quantities (per world-pair, author-indexed card vectors from Q1's verified cross-world path)

- **cos_AB(w)** — mean over authors of cos(card_A(a), card_B(a));
- **r̂_A(w), r̂_B(w)** — the measured card-vs-trait statistic
  (Q1's reading B, `pooled_card_stats` lineage, source re-pinned);
- **Δ(w) = cos_AB(w) − r̂_A(w)·r̂_B(w)** — the paired excess over
  the disattenuation identity (fully paired; frame noise cancels to
  first order).

### Non-degeneracy (the #59 convention, discharged at registration)

The defining contrast: A and B's frame streams differ (C2a);
cos_AB depends on realized error magnitudes and is not forced by
any shared-object identity (the truth object is not swapped
anywhere; both r̂'s and cos_AB are measurements of DIFFERENT vector
pairs). The identity-forcing failure mode of Q1 is absent by
construction; the executor re-verifies in Part 0 that card_A ≠
card_B per pair (norm delta > 0) before any statistic is read.

### Verdicts (rule 22; NULL-first per #55; bands variances-only per #57)

**V-Q1b: mean Δ vs 0**, per φ and pooled — NULL (CI inside ±ε_Δ,
pilot-derived, df-inflated) / POSITIVE / NEGATIVE / UNDERPOWERED.
Consequence entailment (verified): A and B share ONLY the author
stream (C2a), so Δ POSITIVE is entailed to be author-stream content
beyond the trait — no other shared channel exists. Descriptive
(no gates): cos_AB and r̂·r̂ levels per φ; the identity-share
(Δ/cos_AB) quoted UNBUDGETED with CI.

### Leans (sides declared)

**L-1q1b [PURE_TRAIT (Δ NULL) .40 / IDENTITY_BEYOND_TRAIT
(Δ POSITIVE) .40 / ANTI_CORRELATED (Δ NEGATIVE) .05 / underpowered
.15].** The theory pull is real on both sides: T8's disattenuation
identity says NULL if cards are trait-plus-independent-noise; the
a_load carrier (author-stream, non-trait) says POSITIVE if cards
capture author structure beyond b — which would be the ID-card
metaphor measured at card level.

### Gates

- **G0q1b.** (i) Q1's two 0.827 objects and the zero-point identity
  record verified against `results/m4_q1_card_transport/`; (ii)
  instrument hashes vs P3b; (iii) the disattenuation-identity
  lineage located (T8 / the K3-era disattenuated distinctive cosine;
  quote verbatim, rule 24). Mismatch → STOP.
- **G1q1b (rule 10).** C2 battery PASS; per-pair card_A ≠ card_B
  proven before statistics; the Δ estimand's zero-point control: on
  a control pair with the SAME frame seed, cos_AB = cos(card_A,
  card_A) = 1 and Δ = 1 − r̂_A² > 0 by construction — computed and
  disclosed as the operator sanity check (NOT a verdict input).
- **G2q1b (pilot).** 4 pairs × both φ; rule-29 predicate (cosines
  in [−1, 1], null 0, saturation ≥ 0.995); ε_Δ from pilot variances
  only, independence margin 1.25.
- **G3q1b (rule 25).** Projection at truths {Δ = 0;
  Δ = 0.05 (a material identity share)}: ≥ 0.8 power / ≤ 0.1
  false-fire at 384 pairs/φ; once-only escalation to 768 ON THIS
  GATE; else NON_PROJECTABLE.
- **G4q1b.** Routing verified disjoint-and-covering,
  consequence-entailed, antecedent-nondegenerate (#59); rule 24;
  stages: part0 150 s, pilot 60 s, worlds 4 chunks (~230 s),
  score+fit 180 s, finalize 60 s; target < 40 min.

### Routing (rule 16)

| # | condition | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | G0/G1 failure | **STOP / INSTRUMENT_DEFECT** |
| 2 | projection fails after escalation | **NON_PROJECTABLE** |
| 3 | Δ NULL (both φ) | **CARD_PURE_TRAIT** — cards are trait plus frame-independent noise; the disattenuation identity holds at card level; the taxonomy completes: cards read the trait, the gauge reads the frame |
| 4 | Δ POSITIVE (both φ) | **CARD_CARRIES_IDENTITY_BEYOND_TRAIT** — the card transports author-stream content the trait does not span; the ID-card layer of IDT gets its first direct card-space measurement |
| 5 | Δ NEGATIVE (both φ) | **ANTI_CORRELATED_NAMED** — new phenomenon; theory note |
| 6 | φ's disagree in classification | **PHI_SPLIT** — named; the φ-dependence itself becomes the finding |

**⚠ THE SLUG'S STATED CONSEQUENCE IS CONTRADICTED BY THIS LEG'S OWN
ARITHMETIC — read this before quoting the verdict.** Cell 4 says the card
"transports author-stream content the trait does not span". It does not. The
registered Δ scores each card's fidelity against the UNCENTRED trait, but the
card contains the CENTRED trait (`full = w_mu·trait_c + …`, k2b:423). Against
the reference the cards actually share, the per-author exact identity gives
Δ = **-0.0001656789003926287** [-0.0003650943244942132, 3.669093307965161e-05] at φ = 0.05 and

**Why the excess appears.** The only content A and B share is `w_mu·trait_c`
(`slow`, `noise`, `int` are frame-stream and independent — C2a). So the identity
that holds is cos(A,B) = cos(A, trait_c)·cos(B, trait_c), with the CENTRED
reference. Scoring against `trait` (uncentred, k2b:443/446) understates each
card's alignment with what it actually shares, so r̂·r̂ understates cos_AB and Δ
comes out positive **with no content beyond the trait involved**. The
registration's asserted entailment — "Δ POSITIVE is entailed to be author-stream
content beyond the trait — no other shared channel exists" — is false: no other
channel is needed.

**The estimator-family ambiguity turned out immaterial; the reference-object one
did not.** RN-Q1B-1 pinned the family question before any number: cos_AB is a
mean of per-author cosines while `pooled_card_stats` emits both `r_card_b_raw`
(ratio of sums, Q1's "reading B") and `r_card_b_cos` (mean of cosines). All
three UNCENTRED readings agree in classification (True) —
Δ 0.016075551641115206/0.008416861819853795, Δ_cos 0.01614789263012024/0.012168845775779426,
Δ_author 0.012972844117430165/0.009741441150286911, all POSITIVE. The centred
readings do NOT agree with the registered one (False).

**Gates.** G0q1b PASS — Q1's record and both 0.827 objects, the instrument
hashes against Q1's persisted values, and the disattenuation lineage
3/3 located and quoted by code. C2 PASS on
4 fresh probe pairs. **G1q1b PASS on all three clauses**: card_A ≠
card_B for every author of every probe pair (True, smallest
per-author norm delta 0.3250575821476801); the same-frame-seed control
returns cos_AB = 1.0 and Δ = 0.39327233738428 against the
constructed expectation 0.39327233738428 (operator sanity only, excluded from
every band, projection and verdict); and **the 64-dim vectors this leg forms
contract EXACTLY to the columns k2b's own `card_channel_frame` emits**, so the
cosines are built from k2b's cards rather than a lookalike. G2q1b PASS. G3q1b
PASS: false-fire 0.043 at Δ = 0 (bar 0.1) and power 1.0 at
Δ = 0.05 (bar 0.8); escalation did not fire (False).

**#57 compliance.** No pilot correlation is consumed anywhere. Δ is computed
FULLY PAIRED per world-pair, so its per-φ SE needs no covariance at all; the
1.25 independence margin is applied only to the pooled SE, where pooling across
φ would otherwise require one, and is stated there (RN-Q1B-4). Bands were
computed per reading, so each Δ is judged against its own noise.

**Identity share (UNBUDGETED, descriptive).** 0.025416789784261696
[0.025077600856962534, 0.025769072556218135] at φ = 0.05 and 0.01804087613811507 [0.017379655935083557, 0.018705196875479547]
at φ = 0.98 — quoted under the registered reference, and therefore inheriting
its confound. Gates nothing, routes nothing.

**Rule events.** Rule 13: 0 boundary events, B = 2000. Rule 25:
the gate passed at the registered size. Rule 26: no bounded winner. Rule 27: the
identity share carries its UNBUDGETED label. Rule 29: the predicate ran on
cos_AB and Δ at both pilot φ. Rule 30: every cited constant read from its
persisted source; the card path carries file, line and sha256 and was proven
bit-exact in Q1.

**Executor self-report.** Two standing anomalies, both resolved before any
hypothesis-relevant number existed: A-1 the dispatched interpreter is absent (a
pinned CPython 3.12.12 venv built from the lockfile); A-2 `timeout(1)` is
absent on macOS (foreground stages under explicit sub-600 s timeouts).

**Registration-defect candidate (1, and it is the leg).** The registration's
verified consequence-entailment fails because the estimand's REFERENCE OBJECT is
not the object the contrast shares. `trait` (uncentred) is what r̂ scores
against; `trait_c` (centred) is what the card contains and what A and B share.
Both facts are in k2b's source (the card at :423, the truth at :443/446) and
were computable at registration time, so this is the #43/#44/#51/#53/#56/#59
genus again — now at the level of an estimand's **reference object**. The
#59 convention requires the defining contrast to provably DIFFER under the swap;
what this leg shows is that it must also be scored against the object the
contrast actually shares. Suggested extension: **a disattenuation-style identity
must be stated against the component the two measurements share, and the
registration must name that component explicitly.** Non-blocking in the sense
that the computation is valid and the routing well-defined — but material, since
the routed cell's consequence is contradicted; the executor routed as registered
and flagged rather than substituting an estimand.

### Planner adjudication of Q1b (2026-08-14, appended after the run) — THE ROUTED CELL IS VOIDED BY ITS OWN ARITHMETIC; THE CARD IS PURE TRAIT; THE FOUNDING QUESTION HITS ITS INSTRUMENT BOUNDARY

**The routed record (cell 4) stands as routed; its consequence
clause is VOIDED (the #54 pattern, third occurrence); the
substantive finding is CARD_PURE_TRAIT.** The registered Δ scored
the card against the UNCENTRED trait while the card contains
w_mu·trait_c — the CENTRED trait (card composition k2b:423-427;
scoring k2b:443/446). Against the shared component, the per-author
exact identity gives Δ ≈ 0 at both φ (−0.0001657 [−0.0003651,
+0.0000367] and +0.0000785 [−0.0002248, +0.0003876]). The
registration's entailment claim ("no other shared channel exists")
was FALSE — no other channel was needed; the excess was a
reference-object artifact inside the trait channel itself. The
executor pre-pinned both readings before any measurement arm,
routed as registered, and flagged the defect: exemplary conduct,
third consecutive leg.

**Defect #60 (mine — the #43 genus at the level of a REFERENCE
OBJECT).** Both facts sat in k2b's source at registration.
**Convention (adopted from the executor's suggestion verbatim): a
disattenuation-style identity is registered against the SHARED
COMPONENT of the contrast, and the registration names that
component explicitly.**

**The deeper structural fact (appendix KK).** The card's author
content is STRUCTURALLY trait-only on this generator — the card
composition contains no non-trait author channel (a_load never
enters the card). So "identity beyond biography at card level" is
not answerable HERE: not false, UNPOSABLE. What Q1b did measure,
cleanly: the disattenuation identity holds against the shared
component (±0.0004 at both φ) — card errors are frame-independent
across worlds — and the A/B frame components are realized-orthogonal.
**The founding question of this program (is the residual an ID?)
has consumed this generator's capacity: the generator has no
identity channel for any instrument to find. The successor charter
is named — M4-R, the identity-channel generator (plant a per-author
non-trait style channel into the card-visible response path,
certify plantability/detectability/recoverability, then re-pose
Q1b's centred estimand where it can be non-trivially true).**
Registered only after the Q-line closes.

**Q-line state.** Q1 (rule 33, targets differ), Q1b (pure trait at
the shared reference; the structural boundary). Remaining charter
item Q2 is REDESIGNED below under the P3b/P3c lessons (differences,
endpoints, no ratios): the last piece of "the gauge reads frames" —
is THE TAX ITSELF frame-borne? Q3 (layer comparison) stays named.

---

## M4-Q2 — is the tax frame-borne? (the V-response under refreshment)

**REGISTERED 2026-08-14, BEFORE RUN.** Planner: this document's
author; executor: dispatched agent. The N-line's tax curve is a law
of R_nat — a frame-carrying statistic (P-line). If the gauge's
V-RESPONSE also fails to transport across frames, the tax itself is
a frame-agreement phenomenon: the curve κ(V) describes how
person-variance modulates FRAME-reading, not person-reading. The
last structural piece of appendix II's instrument statement.

### Design (differences, endpoints in V; the P3b/P3c lessons in force)

share ∈ {0.10, 0.70} (V = 0.03 / 0.21, the fitted window's
endpoints) × φ = 0.60 × 384 A/B pairs per share (768 pairs, 1536
worlds). Salts `m4q2-author` / `m4q2-frameA` / `m4q2-frameB` /
`m4q2-pilot`, master_seed 20260814. Instrument: P3b's certified
builder (hashes verified; C2 on 4 fresh probes). Quantities per
pair: R_nat and R_ref exactly as P3c (A-gauge vs A-truth / B-truth).
Estimands (joint world-pair bootstrap; shares independent):

- **D_nat = R_nat(V=0.03) − R_nat(V=0.21)** — the natural tax swing
  (anchor: the M-line law predicts it; the executor computes the
  prediction in Part 0 from persisted M1c (0.10, 0.60) and M2 C2
  (0.70, 0.60) cell means, distributional band);
- **D_ref = R_ref(V=0.03) − R_ref(V=0.21)** — the transported tax
  swing;
- descriptive: D_ref/D_nat, UNBUDGETED.

Non-degeneracy (the #59/#60 conventions, discharged at
registration): R_ref at the two shares are measurements of
different worlds with no shared-object identity forcing equality;
the shared-component analysis is the SAME as P3c's (nothing is
scored against an object it does not contain; both scorings use
each world's own truth panels).

### Verdicts (rule 22; NULL-first; bands variances-only, #57)

- **V-Q2a:** D_nat vs 0 — POSITIVE expected (anchor-like; failure →
  INSTRUMENT_DEFECT since the M-line law predicts ≈ +0.117 from
  persisted cells, planner sanity value, executor recomputes).
- **V-Q2b:** D_ref vs 0 — NULL (CI inside ±ε, pilot-derived) /
  POSITIVE / NEGATIVE / UNDERPOWERED.

### Leans (sides declared)

**L-1q2 [TAX_FRAME_BORNE (D_ref NULL) .55 / TAX_PARTIALLY_
TRANSPORTS (POSITIVE) .25 / other .20].**

### Gates

G0q2: P3c/Q1b cited numbers verified; M1c (0.10, 0.60) and M2 C2
cell means at full precision; instrument hashes. G1q2: C2 battery;
per-pair frame difference. G2q2: pilot 4 pairs × both shares,
rule-29 predicate, ε from variances with the 1.25 margin. G3q2:
projection at truths {D_ref = 0; D_ref = 0.117·(P3c transportable
share point 0.115)} — i.e. the partial-transport truth ≈ 0.0134 —
≥ 0.8 / ≤ 0.1 at 384; once-only escalation to 768 ON THIS GATE.
G4q2: routing disjoint/covering/entailed/antecedent-nondegenerate;
rule 24; stages part0 150 s, pilot 60 s, worlds 4 chunks, score+fit
180 s, finalize 60 s; target < 40 min.

### Routing (rule 16)

| # | condition | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | G0/G1 failure | **STOP / INSTRUMENT_DEFECT** |
| 2 | projection fails after escalation | **NON_PROJECTABLE** |
| 3 | V-Q2a not POSITIVE | **INSTRUMENT_DEFECT** (the anchor is the M-line law) |
| 4 | V-Q2b NULL | **TAX_FRAME_BORNE** — the V-response is frame-agreement; the N-line curve is re-typed as the frame channel's V-response; appendix II completes |
| 5 | V-Q2b POSITIVE | **TAX_PARTIALLY_TRANSPORTS** — a person-borne tax component exists; quantified descriptively |
| 6 | V-Q2b NEGATIVE | **TAX_INVERSION_NAMED** — theory note |
| 7 | any UNDERPOWERED (no higher cell) | **UNDERPOWERED** |

**D_ref = -0.0022020717726400894 [-0.005350034376011563, 0.0010185625621798886] → NULL** (ε = 0.007413654845687905), against a
natural tax swing **D_nat = 0.1196454983533797 [0.11590855681080722, 0.1232498969832857]**.

**The levels first (RN-Q2-5, pinned in Part 0).** A NULL D_ref is largely
CONFIRMATORY given P3c's near-zero R_ref, so the levels are stated before the
difference:

| share | V | n | R_nat mean | R_nat SEM | R_ref mean | R_ref SEM |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 0.03 | 384 | 0.16306830159907398 | 0.0014179003281448192 | -0.0007786103879736543 | 0.0011820408887000167 |
| 0.7 | 0.21 | 384 | 0.04342280324569429 | 0.0011174156760681603 | 0.001423461384666435 | 0.0010773169597756112 |

**R_nat falls from 0.16306830159907398 at V = 0.03 to 0.04342280324569429 at V = 0.21
— the tax, plainly visible and large. R_ref sits at -0.0007786103879736543 and
0.001423461384666435 — flat at zero at BOTH V.** The frame-refreshed reading has no
level to lose, which is exactly why its difference is null. The honest reading
is the conjunction: the V-response exists only in the frame-carrying statistic.

**V-Q2a, the anchor — PASS.** The M-line prediction was recomputed in Part 0
from M1c's (0.10, 0.60) cell (mean 0.16156034289722412, SEM
0.0019744651453781504, n 192) and M2's C2 (mean
0.04354391388413511, SEM 0.001616665195874819, n 192):
**predicted D_nat = 0.11801642901308901** (SEM 0.002551885374750623). Measured
0.1196454983533797; difference 0.0016290693402906953, **z = 0.5211540361150766**,
inside the pinned band 0.008841347453659845 (True) and inside the
plain 2-SE band 0.006251776739309291 (True). The instrument
reproduces the M-line law, so D_ref can be interpreted rather than doubted.

**RN-Q2-6 (an anticipated, non-gating divergence, recorded before any
measurement).** The registration quotes the prediction as "≈ +0.117 … planner
sanity value, executor recomputes". The recomputation gives 0.11801642901308901 —
0.0010164290130890014 above it, rounding to 0.118 rather than 0.117
(matches to 3 dp: False). Rule 30 licenses an expressly-approximate
quote, so this is **not** a defect and does not gate; the recomputed value
controls and both are recorded. For scale the divergence is about a seventh of
the anchor band. My first Part-0 draft made the 3-dp match a PASS condition and
failed G0 on it — my own over-strict gate, corrected before any arm ran, with no
number affected.

**RN-Q2-1 (the anchor band, pinned before any measurement).** The registration
says "distributional band" without fixing k, and the two source cells come from
DIFFERENT legs on different salts (M1c and M2), so the comparison is
distributional by necessity. PINNED: band = 2·√2·√(SEM_pred² + SEM_meas²),
matching the V-P3a/C1′ convention; the plain 2-SE reading is reported beside it.
They agree here.

**V-Q2b.** D_ref = -0.0022020717726400894 [-0.005350034376011563, 0.0010185625621798886] against ε = 0.007413654845687905 →
**NULL**; the sign-first reading agrees (True). The CI lies entirely
inside the equivalence band and straddles zero.

**The ratio, UNBUDGETED.** D_ref/D_nat = -0.0184049697058902 [-0.044787633515569504, 0.008345157757188915], width
0.05313279127275842 — descriptive only, gating and routing nothing (the P3b lesson
kept visible), and the only place the 1.25 independence margin touches anything.

**Gates.** G0q2 PASS (instrument hashes match P3c's persisted, True;
the anchor cells at full precision; P3c's and Q1b's verdicts). C2 PASS on
4 fresh probe pairs. G2q2 PASS. G3q2 PASS: false-fire 0.043 at
D_ref = 0 (bar 0.1) and power 0.9485 at the partial-transport truth
0.013614431430092793 (bar 0.8, derived as the recomputed anchor times P3c's
transportable share point 0.115360476028154); escalation did not fire
(False).

**#57 and #60 both honoured explicitly.** No pilot correlation is consumed:
D_nat and D_ref each difference two INDEPENDENT shares, so their SEs need no
covariance term, and the 1.25 margin is applied only to the ratio's band and
stated there; the within-pair R_nat/R_ref correlation is handled by joint index
resampling, never by estimating a correlation. The #60 shared-component check is
STATED, not merely satisfied (RN-Q2-4): both scorings use each world's OWN truth
panel from k2b's `emit_panel`, and the contrast is between two SHARES rather
than two reference objects — so nothing is scored against an object it does not
contain, which was Q1b's failure mode.

**Rule events.** Rule 13: 0 boundary events, B = 2000. Rule 25:
the gate passed at the registered size. Rule 26: no bounded winner. Rule 27: the
ratio carries its UNBUDGETED label. Rule 29: the predicate ran on BOTH scorings
at every arm. Rule 30: every cited constant read from its persisted source and
the anchor prediction RECOMPUTED rather than quoted.

**Executor self-report.** Three anomalies, all resolved before any
hypothesis-relevant number existed: A-1 the dispatched interpreter is absent (a
pinned CPython 3.12.12 venv built from the lockfile); A-2 `timeout(1)` is
absent on macOS (foreground stages under explicit sub-600 s timeouts); A-3 my
own over-strict G0 gate on the approximate sanity value, described above and
corrected before any arm.

**Registration-defect candidates: none.** The registration pinned what needed
pinning and, notably, labelled its sanity value as approximate with the
recomputation handed to the executor — rule 30 operating as designed rather than
being violated. The one ambiguity (the anchor band's k) was pinned as RN-Q2-1
before any measurement and both readings agree.

### Planner adjudication of Q2 (2026-08-14, appended after the run) — THE TAX IS FRAME-BORNE; THE INSTRUMENT STATEMENT COMPLETES; THE LINE CLOSES

**TAX_FRAME_BORNE accepted — zero registration defects, and the
M-line law's first outing AS AN INSTRUMENT: the recomputed
prediction 0.11801642901308901 anchored the measured D_nat =
0.1196454983533797 at z = 0.521.** The levels carry it: R_nat falls
0.16306830159907398 → 0.04342280324569429 across V = 0.03 → 0.21
(the tax, 3.8×) while R_ref sits at zero at BOTH V (−0.00078 /
+0.00142); D_ref = −0.0022020717726400894 [−0.005350034376011563,
+0.0010185625621798886] → NULL against ε = 0.0074. **The
V-response — the tax itself — is frame-agreement.** With P2
(injection), P3c (level and φ-gradient) and Q2 (V-response), every
measured face of the gauge's b-only statistic is frame-borne;
appendix II's instrument statement is COMPLETE (appendix LL). The
N-line's tax curve κ(V) is hereby re-typed by dated note as **the
frame channel's V-response** — its laws, seals and closure all
stand; what changed is what the curve is a law OF. The executor's
A-3 (its own over-strict G0 gate on the expressly-approximate
sanity value, corrected pre-arm) is rule 30's approximate-label
operating as designed.

**THE LINE CLOSES.** Three legs: Q1 INEXPRESSIBLE (rule 33 — the
two layers read different targets), Q1b CARD_PURE_TRAIT at the
shared reference (defect #60; the structural boundary, appendix
KK), Q2 TAX_FRAME_BORNE (clean). Q3 (reader-side vs generator-side
refreshment head-to-head) stays NAMED, not queued. Synthesis:
`docs/SUICA_M4_Q_TRANSPORT_LINE_SYNTHESIS.md`. Successor: **M4-R,
the identity-channel generator** (KK.3) — registered as its own
line.
