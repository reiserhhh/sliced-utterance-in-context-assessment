# SUICA M4-R — The Identity-Channel Line

Line opened 2026-08-14, on the Q-line's close. Question: **make the
founding question posable.** This program began with the conjecture
that the residual is not error but IDENTITY — an ID card. Five
closed lines later, the k2b family's verdict is structural: its
cards carry ONLY biography (the trait); there is no non-trait author
channel for any instrument to find (appendix KK). The R-line builds
one: a per-author, persistent, non-trait STYLE channel planted into
the card-visible response path, with a zero-default weight so the
extension certifies backward bit-identity. Once certified, the
program's identity instruments (the centred cross-frame cosine, the
frame-refreshed discriminator, the taxometer, the completeness
meter) can be pointed at a world that can answer YES or NO.

Tier: EXPLORATORY, label-free, synthetic. The ledger controls.
Registrations before run, append-only. Standing rules 1–33 bind;
ALL conventions in force (notably: #59 non-degeneracy of estimand
contrasts and cell antecedents; #60 disattenuation identities name
their shared component; #57 pilot correlations never consumed; #56
inheritance is not exemption; the #43 planner-arithmetic family).
Execution conventions as always (ONE commit per leg
`feat(m4-r): ...`, never amended, never pushed; chunked foreground
stages < 600 s; `suica_core/`, k2b and the P3b instrument
READ-ONLY — R-legs import P3b's builder and EXTEND it inside their
own scripts by minimal extraction with provenance).

## Line charter

- **R1 — the identity-channel instrument** (registered below):
  build `build_split_world_v2` (planted style channel,
  zero-default), certify backward identity / channel placement /
  quantitative recoverability.
- **R2 — the identity phenomenology** (named; register only after
  R1 certifies): does the gauge tax style like it taxes trait?
  does style transport across frames (it must — it is
  author-stream — the test is that the INSTRUMENTS see it)?
  does the frame-refreshed discriminator (T6″ pattern) separate
  planted style from forged frame-stability?
- **R3 — the taxometer on identity mixtures** (named): η̂ and the
  completeness meter against style/trait mixture worlds.

## M4-R1 — the identity-channel instrument

**REGISTERED 2026-08-14, BEFORE RUN.** Planner: this document's
author; executor: dispatched agent. An INSTRUMENT leg: no theory
verdict, only certificates.

### The extension (rules 9/12 — minimal extraction with provenance)

`build_split_world_v2(author_seed, frame_seed, phi_slow, w_style)`,
inside `scripts/run_suica_m4_r1_identity_channel.py`, extending
P3b's certified builder (imported by file, hashes verified):

- **style_a** — one vector per author, dimension DIM, drawn on the
  AUTHOR stream as its LAST draw (prefix property: all existing
  author objects remain bit-identical);
- **placement** — style enters the RESPONSE path at exactly the
  site where the trait enters (the w_mu·trait term in the panel
  emission; executor pins file:line and mirrors it as
  + w_style·style_a per response), so the card picks up
  w_style·style_c̄ precisely as it picks up the trait — a
  card-visible, author-persistent, NON-TRAIT channel;
- **w_style units** — multiples of the trait weight w_mu (executor
  pins w_mu's persisted value); w_style = 0 is the default.

### Certification battery (the leg IS the battery)

- **C-R1a (backward identity):** at w_style = 0, worlds, panels,
  cards and fields BIT-IDENTICAL to the P3b builder — 8 probe
  pairs × φ ∈ {0.05, 0.60}; any difference → INSTRUMENT_DEFECT.
- **C-R1b (channel placement):** style_a is author-stream
  (bit-identical across frame seeds, C2a-style), independent of
  trait (per-world author-level cos(style, trait): mean within 2·SE
  of 0, realized values reported); the card's style component is
  CENTRED style (verified against the composition, the #60
  lesson — the shared component of an A/B pair at w_style > 0 is
  w_mu·trait_c + w_style·style_c, NAMED here as required).
- **C-R1c (quantitative recoverability):** at w_style ∈ {0.5, 1.0}
  × 128 A/B pairs (share 0.25, φ 0.60): the centred cross-frame
  excess Δ_style = cos_AB − r̂_A·r̂_B (r̂ scored against the CENTRED
  TRAIT ONLY — so the planted style appears as excess) must be (i)
  ≈ 0 at w_style = 0 (the Q1b-corrected null re-confirmed on v2);
  (ii) POSITIVE at 0.5 and 1.0; (iii) MONOTONE (Δ(1.0) > Δ(0.5),
  CIs disjoint or ordering stable at B = 20000); (iv) INSIDE the
  algebraic prediction band derived in Part 0 from the composition
  weights (deterministic arithmetic: the expected excess from a
  planted share, executor derives and persists BEFORE the arms;
  rule 30 — executed provenance).
- **Non-degeneracy (#59, discharged at registration):** Δ_style at
  w > 0 is not forced — it depends on realized norms and the
  planted weight; the w = 0 null is the Q1b-verified behaviour of
  the UNEXTENDED builder, not an identity of the extension.

### Design

share 0.25, φ 0.60; w_style ∈ {0, 0.5, 1.0} × 128 A/B pairs each
(384 pairs, 768 worlds) + the C-R1a/b probe sets. Salts
`m4r1-author` / `m4r1-frameA` / `m4r1-frameB` / `m4r1-pilot`,
master_seed 20260814. G2r1 pilot: 4 pairs at w ∈ {0, 1.0},
rule-29 predicate; bands variances-only (#57). G3r1 projection:
detection power for Δ_style at w = 1.0 ≥ 0.8 with ≤ 0.1 false-fire
at w = 0, at 128 pairs; once-only escalation to 256 ON THIS GATE.
G4r1: routing disjoint/covering/entailed/antecedent-nondegenerate;
rule 24; stages: part0 150 s (incl. the algebraic band), pilot
60 s, worlds 3 chunks (~200 s), score 120 s, finalize 60 s; target
< 35 min.

### Leans

**L-1r1 [CERTIFIED .70 / a named certificate fails .25 / other
.05].**

### Routing (rule 16)

|---|---|---|
| 1 | G0/import/hash failure | **STOP** |
| 2 | projection fails after escalation | **NON_PROJECTABLE** |
| 3 | all four certificates PASS | **IDENTITY_CHANNEL_CERTIFIED** — R2 becomes registrable; the founding question is posable |
| 4 | any certificate fails | **INSTRUMENT_DEFECT(name)** — the failing certificate is the finding; handback |

### Deliverables and budget

### M4-R1 outcome (appended after execution; registration above unedited)

**INSTRUMENT_DEFECT(C-R1c) — routing cell 4.** INSTRUMENT_DEFECT(name) -- the failing certificate is the finding. Harness
`scripts/run_suica_m4_r1_identity_channel.py`; report
`reports/SUICA_M4_R1_IDENTITY_CHANNEL_REPORT.md`; artifacts
`results/m4_r1_identity_channel/` (gitignored). 768 worlds
(128 A/B pairs per dose) plus the probe sets.

**THE CHANNEL WORKS; MY BAND WAS TOO TIGHT.** C-R1a, C-R1b and G2r1 all PASS.
C-R1c fails on its **fourth clause only**, and the failure is in the Part-0
band, not in the planted channel.

**The extension needs no k2b edit.** The trait enters the response path at
exactly one site — **`scripts/run_suica_m4_k2b_t4_branch.py:371`**: `v += w["mu"] * world["trait"][i][None, :]`. The registration asks
for the mirror `+ w_style·style_a` there and specifies w_style in multiples of
w_mu (**0.33541019662496846**, bit-exact against the persisted value: True).
Writing w_style = m·w_mu, `w_mu·trait + w_style·style = w_mu·(trait + m·style)`
EXACTLY, so publishing `trait_eff = trait + m·style` as the world's `trait`
makes k2b's own UNEDITED `emit_panel` carry style at precisely the trait's site,
in the observed panel and in every truth panel using `"mu"`. `trait_pure` and
`style` are published separately for C-R1c and C-R1b. k2b, `suica_core/` and the
P3b builder stay READ-ONLY; P3b's hashes match P3c's persisted (True).
`style_z` is the LAST author-stream draw, so the prefix property preserves every
earlier draw.

**C-R1a PASS** — backward bit-identity at w_style = 0 across 16
probes at φ ∈ {0.05, 0.60}: objects True, panels True,
cards True, fields True (4 checks). The
extension is inert at zero, so every prior result on the P3b builder stands.

**C-R1b PASS** — style is author-stream (True: bit-identical
across frame seeds), independent of trait (cos(style_c, trait_c) =
0.002430979842622228, SE 0.0014745152709377159, within 2 SE of zero: True), and
the card recomposes exactly from its named parts (True). **The shared
component is NAMED as #60 requires: w_mu * trait_c + w_style * style_c (centred trait PLUS centred style).** r̂ is scored against
the CENTRED TRAIT ONLY, deliberately, so the planted style appears as excess
rather than being absorbed — the direct lesson of Q1b's defect.

**C-R1c — three clauses pass, the fourth fails.**

| w_style | n | measured Δ | 95% CI | predicted | persisted band | inside | measured − predicted |

- **(i) PASS** — Δ = 0.00027221510546395313 [-0.00015154691455664595, 0.0006871194716920599] at w = 0, inside ±0.00075116719103521;
  the Q1b-corrected null re-confirmed on v2.
- **(ii) PASS** — POSITIVE at both doses.
- **(iii) PASS** — MONOTONE: P(Δ₁.₀ > Δ₀.₅) = 1.0 and
  P(Δ₀.₅ > Δ₀.₀) = 1.0 at B = 2000.
- **(iv) FAIL** — containment in the Part-0 band: False / True /
  False.

**The band's defect, diagnosed POST HOC (routing nothing).** The band was
persisted before the arms as required and it ROUTES — retuning after seeing the
measurement is exactly the move this programme forbids, so the verdict stands.
But it has two flaws, both mine:

| w_style | persisted band width | degenerate? | SE_pred | SE_meas | gap / combined SE | inside a CORRECTED band |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.0 | 0.0 | True | 0.0 | 0.00021684323861539953 | 1.2553543619903362 | True |
| 0.5 | 0.0012511872225267062 | False | 0.0003127968056316807 | 0.0002233080066693018 | -0.02697499342954882 | True |
| 1.0 | 0.003016185922386061 | False | 0.000754046480596509 | 0.00032032174018175404 | -4.174779893852667 | False |

(a) **At w = 0 the band is degenerate**: the prediction is exactly 0 at every
probe world, so its SE is exactly 0 and the band has **zero width** — no
measured value except a literal 0.0 could pass. Clause (i) already tests w = 0
properly against ε and passes, so clause (iv) is testing an empty object there.
(b) **At w > 0 the band carries only the prediction's probe spread**, ignoring
the measurement's SE and — decisively — the DERIVATION's approximation error:
the algebra assumes per-author orthogonality of t, s and n (realized
cos = 0.002430979842622228, not 0) and equates a ratio of means with a mean of ratios
(Jensen). Both grow with b, which is the observed pattern exactly: the gap is
-8.137627836536472e-05 of the prediction at w = 0.5 and -0.009256071699142823 at w = 1.0, the
latter -4.174779893852667 combined SE — outside even a measurement-aware band.

**A correct band** would be predicted ± 2·√(SE_pred² + SE_meas² + SE_approx²)
with SE_approx estimated from the realized per-author spread of
bᵢ/(aᵢ+bᵢ+dᵢ) rather than from the ratio of means. That is the handback.

**The algebraic band itself (executed provenance, persisted BEFORE the arms).**
With a = E‖w_mu·trait_c‖², b = E‖w_style·style_c‖², d = E‖frame remainder‖²,
Δ = b/(a+b+d) in expectation — exactly 0 at w = 0 and increasing thereafter.
a, b, d were MEASURED on probe worlds; predictions 0.0 / 0.12739898980740494 /
0.3695134875442334.

**G3r1 PASS**: false-fire 0.043 at w = 0 (bar 0.1), power 1.0 at
the algebraic w = 1.0 truth (bar 0.8); escalation did not fire (False).

**Rule events.** Rule 13: 0 events, B = 2000. Rule 25: passed.
Rule 26: no bounded winner. Rule 27: no budgeted consumption. Rule 29: the
predicate ran at every arm. Rule 30: the band derived from MEASURED probe norms
and persisted before the arms; w_mu and the P3b hashes verified at source. #57:
no pilot correlation consumed — Δ is a per-pair scalar. #59: Δ at w > 0 is not
forced; the w = 0 null is the unextended builder's verified behaviour. #60: the
shared component is named.

**Executor self-report.** Two standing anomalies, both resolved before any
hypothesis-relevant number existed: A-1 the dispatched interpreter is absent (a
pinned CPython 3.12.12 venv built from the lockfile); A-2 `timeout(1)` is
absent on macOS. **The band's defect is a third, and it is mine** — but unlike
A-1/A-2 it could not be caught before the measurement existed, which is why it
is reported as a diagnosed failure rather than a corrected one.

**Registration-defect candidates: none.** The registration specified clause (iv)
correctly; what failed is the executor's construction of the band it names. Worth
recording as a convention candidate for the planner: **a prediction band tested
for containment must carry the derivation's approximation error, not only the
prediction's sampling spread — and a band whose predicted value is a
deterministic constant has zero width and cannot be a containment test at all.**
That is the rule-32 estimator-noise-floor family applied to a PREDICTION rather
than a measurement.

**What this leaves.** The channel is planted, inert at zero, author-stream,
trait-independent, card-visible, and recoverable with a monotone dose response
matching the composition arithmetic to within 1%. What is NOT certified is the
quantitative containment claim, because the band that was supposed to test it
could not. A successor leg re-banding clause (iv) — with no change to the
instrument — would close it.

### Planner adjudication of R1 (2026-08-14, appended after the run) — THE CHANNEL WORKS; THE BAND WAS THE DEFECT

**INSTRUMENT_DEFECT(C-R1c) accepted — and localized: clauses
(i)/(ii)/(iii) PASS, C-R1a/C-R1b PASS, the projection PASSES; what
failed is the planner's Part-0 band, on clause (iv) alone.** The
channel is planted (Δ monotone P = 1.0, matching the composition
arithmetic to −0.008% at w = 0.5 and −0.93% at w = 1.0), inert at
zero (bit-identical objects, panels, cards, fields — every prior
P3b result stands), author-stream, trait-independent
(cos = +0.0024, within 2 SE of 0), with the shared component named
per #60. The executor's construction is more minimal than the
registration asked: **no site mirroring at all** — w_mu·trait +
w_style·style = w_mu·(trait + m·style), so publishing trait_eff
lets k2b's own unedited `emit_panel` (k2b:371, w_mu =
0.33541019662496846) carry style at exactly the trait's site, with
trait_pure kept separate for scoring.

**Defect #61 (mine).** The containment band (a) had ZERO WIDTH at
the deterministic w = 0 point — a band around a constant cannot be
a containment test (rule 31's one-reachable-side pathology, at the
band level); and (b) omitted two error sources at w > 0 — the
measurement's SE and, decisively, the DERIVATION'S approximation
error (realized non-orthogonality + Jensen), which grows with the
planted share exactly as the −4.17-SE gap at w = 1.0 shows.
**Convention (rules 31/32 family, applied to predictions): a
containment band on a derived prediction carries width
2·√(SE_pred² + SE_meas² + SE_approx²), with SE_approx estimated
from the realized deviation of the derivation's assumptions;
deterministic points are tested by equivalence bands (ε), never by
containment.** The executor's refusal to retune after seeing the
measurement was correct and is the reason the defect is clean.

---

## M4-R1b — clause (iv), re-banded and tested prospectively

**REGISTERED 2026-08-14, BEFORE RUN.** Planner: this document's
author; executor: dispatched agent. The instrument is UNCHANGED
(same script's builder, same hashes); only clause (iv) is re-posed.
Because R1's measured Δ values are on the record, a re-banded test
on the SAME doses adjudicates nothing prospectively — so the
primary test is a FRESH dose.

### Design

- **Primary (prospective containment):** w_style = **0.75** (never
  measured) × 128 A/B pairs (256 worlds; share 0.25, φ 0.60; salts
  `m4r1b-author` / `m4r1b-frameA` / `m4r1b-frameB` / `m4r1b-pilot`,
  master_seed 20260814). Part 0 derives the algebraic prediction at
  0.75 AND the corrected band per the #61 convention — SE_approx
  from the realized per-author spread of bᵢ/(aᵢ+bᵢ+dᵢ) on the
  PROBE worlds (pre-measurement objects), persisted and hashed
  BEFORE the fresh arms (K2f ordering; the pilot after the stamp).
- **Secondary (re-scoring, adjudicating nothing):** R1's persisted
  w ∈ {0.5, 1.0} measurements against the corrected band — reported
  as consistency readings with the post-hoc label.
- **w = 0 clause:** re-typed as the EQUIVALENCE test it always was
  — R1's clause (i) result stands as its verdict (no new worlds).

### Verdicts and routing (rule 16)

**V-R1b:** measured Δ(0.75) inside the corrected band — two-sided
containment. Lean [.70]. Cells: **STOP** (G0/hash mismatch) /
**NON_PROJECTABLE** (projection at the corrected band's width:
false-fire ≤ 0.1 under Δ = algebraic − 3·band, power ≥ 0.8 at the
algebraic truth; escalation to 256 pairs once, ON THIS GATE) /
**IDENTITY_CHANNEL_CERTIFIED** (V-R1b inside — C-R1c closes; with
C-R1a/b standing, the instrument is certified and R2 becomes
registrable) / **BAND_STILL_WRONG** (outside — the derivation error
model is inadequate; handback with the realized decomposition).

### Deliverables and budget

tables); outcome append HERE; one ledger row (EXPLORATORY); exactly
ONE commit `feat(m4-r): R1b — clause (iv) re-banded — <SLUG>`,
never amended, never pushed; suite green first. 256 worlds
(+escalation ×2) + pilot; target < 20 min, every stage < 600 s.

### Outcome of M4-R1b (executed 2026-08-14, append-only)

**`IDENTITY_CHANNEL_CERTIFIED` (rule-16 cell 3).** Clause (iv)
closes prospectively at a dose that had never been measured.

- **The corrected band, all three terms from PROBE worlds** (the pilot runs
  after the stamp, so no term may come from it). Prediction at w = 0.75 =
  `0.2476172270351607` (ratio-of-means, R1's form, unchanged — RN-R1B-3);
  SE_pred = `0.00045459114785961074`, SE_meas = `0.0002683462385382117`, SE_approx =
  `0.002186151999363512`; combined `0.002248982743324414`; half-width
  `0.004497965486648828`; band `[0.24311926154851188, 0.25211519252180953]`. **SE_approx dominates** — it is
  4.809050967351109x SE_pred and 8.146758498544077x
  SE_meas, i.e. the term R1's band omitted was the only one that mattered.
- **Ordering.** `prediction.json` hashed `dd5912a4c219c651df501488ed3bdcd5455bdb968865579c93f13570fcb57c95` and stamped
  2026-08-14T08:43:42.897504+00:00 with **0 fresh-arm
  worlds in existence**; the arm re-read the stamp from disk and re-hashed to a
  match 18.305773 s later. 32
  probe worlds necessarily precede the stamp — they are the band's inputs — and
  are counted separately (RN-R1B-4).
- **G3r1b PASS.** At the corrected width: power
  1.0 at the algebraic
  truth (bar 0.8) and false-fire
  0.0
  at prediction − 3·band (bar 0.1). Escalation fired: False.
- **V-R1b PASS.** Measured Δ(0.75) = `0.24614231318551627` [0.24556658406745574, 0.24677281301031784],
  signed error `-0.0014749138496444325`, **position -0.3279068845731195** of
  the half-width. INSIDE.
- **The correction is load-bearing, not a convenient widening.** The residual is
  -0.6746620775105513 of SE_approx but
  -4.8949869838067945 of the measurement's own SEM — the
  measurement is far more precise than the prediction is accurate, which is the
  whole content of #61. **Under R1's band form** (2·√(SE_pred² + SE_meas²),
  half-width `0.0010557704588591693`) **this leg would have
  landed at -1.3970023855736367 and FAILED
  (False)** — the identical failure would have
  recurred at a fresh dose.
- **Secondary (post-hoc, adjudicating nothing).** R1's gaps re-scored against
  this half-width: w = 0.5 gap `-1.0367255658033647e-05` (inside:
  True), w = 1.0 gap
  `-0.0034202433345097427` (inside:
  True). Reported as consistency
  readings only; the routing uses w = 0.75 alone (RN-R1B-1). The w = 0 clause is
  re-typed as equivalence and R1's clause (i) stands as its verdict.
- **Executor anomaly A-3, AFTER the verdict existed.** The report template —
  written before the run — asserted the measurement would sit closer to the
  per-author mean-of-ratios, that being "what the measurement actually
  estimates" (Part 0's own words). It does not: the measurement is
  `-0.0038555197801447283` from the arm's
  mean-of-ratios versus `-0.0014749138496444325` from the stamped
  ratio-of-means, so **the pre-pinned form was the closer one and I did not know
  that when I pinned it**. Had the mean-of-ratios been stamped the position would
  have been -0.8571697118594949 — still inside
  (True), but near the edge. The containment verdict is
  robust to the form choice; the comfort of the margin is not. The residual is
  therefore NOT the Jensen form gap — it runs the other way and is larger, and
  SE_approx covers it because that spread sets the right *scale* for the
  derivation's error, not because it names its mechanism. The false sentence was
  replaced by §5.1's generated decomposition. No number changed;
  `prediction.json` is untouched and still re-hashes to the stamp.
- **Consequence.** With C-R1a, C-R1b and clauses (i)–(iii) standing from R1, the
  identity channel is **certified**: planted, inert at zero, author-stream,
  trait-independent, card-visible, monotone in dose, and quantitatively
  recoverable inside a band fixed before the measurement existed. M4-R2 becomes
  registrable. Nothing here bears on the k2b family's own worlds — the channel
  is planted, not discovered, and appendix KK's boundary is unmoved.
- Rule 13: 0 events. Report: `reports/SUICA_M4_R1B_REBAND_REPORT.md`.
- **No registration-defect candidates.** The registration specified the leg
  correctly, including the prescription for SE_approx.

### Planner adjudication of R1b (2026-08-14, appended after the run) — CERTIFIED, WITH THE CORRECTION PROVEN LOAD-BEARING

**IDENTITY_CHANNEL_CERTIFIED accepted — zero registration defects.**
Δ(0.75) = 0.24614231318551627 landed inside the #61-corrected band
[0.24311926154851188, 0.25211519252180953] at position −0.328, with
the stamp preceding every fresh world (0 at stamp; permit by
re-hash +18.3 s). Two facts elevate this beyond a pass: (i) **the
correction is load-bearing** — under R1's band form the same fresh
dose FAILS at −1.397; SE_approx (0.002186) dominates SE_pred (4.8×)
and SE_meas (8.1×) — the omitted term was the only one that
mattered; (ii) the executor's A-3 (its own template expectation
about the mean-of-ratios form was WRONG — the pre-pinned
ratio-of-means was closer, verdict robust to the choice, margin
comfort not) is the rule-30 culture auditing even its own prose
post-verdict, disclosed with timing. **C-R1c closes; with C-R1a/b
standing, the identity-channel instrument is CERTIFIED. The
founding question is posable. R2 is registrable.**

## M4-R2 — the gauge meets the identity channel

**REGISTERED 2026-08-14, BEFORE RUN.** Planner: this document's
author; executor: dispatched agent. Three questions, one of them
SEALED — the program's laws predicting the consequence of the new
channel:

1. **Interference (SEALED):** does planted identity CROWD OUT the
   reading of biography? The tax curve says yes, quantitatively:
   style adds author-persistent variance, raising the EFFECTIVE
   person share, and the N-line curve prices that.
2. **Within-frame style reading (DESCRIPTIVE ONLY):** at w = 1.0
   (equal weights), trait and style enter the response
   EXCHANGEABLY, so R_S ≈ R_T is a symmetry, not a finding (#59
   discharged by declaring it descriptive).
3. **Cross-frame style reading (VERDICT):** style is author-stream
   — it is PRESENT in both worlds of a pair. Can the gauge read it
   across frames? The P-line predicts NO even though the identity
   exists — the sharpest form of the gauge's limitation.

### Design

v2 builder (certified; hashes verified), share 0.25, φ 0.60,
w_style ∈ {0, 1.0} × 192 A/B pairs each (384 pairs, 768 worlds).
Salts `m4r2-author` / `m4r2-frameA` / `m4r2-frameB` / `m4r2-pilot`,
master_seed 20260814. Truth panels: the pipeline's own construction
fed with trait_pure and with style (executor pins the truth-panel
machinery file:line, rule 12; the truth semantics are the
pipeline's, unchanged). Quantities per pair: R_T_nat (A-gauge vs
A's trait_pure truth), R_S_nat (vs A's style truth), R_S_ref (vs
B's style truth), at both w.

### The sealed prediction (Part 0 → hash → worlds; #61-compliant band)

ΔR_T = R_T_nat(w=1) − R_T_nat(w=0), predicted from the N-line curve
at the EFFECTIVE person share: the executor derives V_eff on probe
worlds from realized channel variances (the share accounting of
`person_share_design`'s own semantics, pinned file:line), computes
the curve prediction α(V_eff) − α(V_design) from M3's persisted
(c, κ0, κ2), and carries the r-channel's shift and every
derivation approximation inside SE_approx (the #61 convention:
band = 2·√(SE_pred² + SE_meas² + SE_approx²); planner sanity value
≈ −0.06, expressly approximate, executor recomputes). Prediction +
band hashed BEFORE any fresh world (K2f ordering; pilot after
stamp).

### Verdicts (rule 22; NULL-first; #57 bands)

- **V-R2a (sealed):** measured ΔR_T inside the band — two-sided.
  Leans [.45 inside / .25 negative-but-outside / .20 NULL (no
  interference — the law does not transport to the new channel) /
  .10 other].
- **V-R2c:** R_S_ref(w=1) vs 0, NULL-first (ε from pilot,
  variances only). Lean NULL [.60] — the gauge cannot read identity
  across frames even when it exists.
- Descriptive: R_S_nat vs R_T_nat at w = 1 (the exchangeability
  reading, no gate); R_S_nat(w=0) as the null anchor (style drawn
  but weightless — expected ≈ 0, anchor not verdict).

### Gates

G0r2: R1/R1b certified values + instrument hashes + M3 curve params
at source; the truth-panel machinery pinned. G1r2: C2-style battery
on 4 fresh probes; per-pair frame difference; style-truth panels
differ from trait-truth panels provably (norm delta; #59). G2r2:
pilot 4 pairs × both w, rule-29 predicate on all three scorings.
G3r2: projection — power ≥ 0.8 for V-R2a at the curve truth and
false-fire ≤ 0.1 at ΔR_T = 0; V-R2c false-fire ≤ 0.1 at 0 with
power ≥ 0.8 at R_S_ref = R_S_nat(w=1)'s pilot value; 192 pairs,
once-only escalation to 384 ON THIS GATE. G4r2: routing
disjoint/covering/entailed/antecedent-nondegenerate; rule 24;
stages part0 240 s (derivation + stamp), pilot 60 s, worlds 4
chunks, score 180 s, finalize 60 s; target < 45 min.

### Routing (rule 16)

| # | condition | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | G0/G1 failure | **STOP / INSTRUMENT_DEFECT** |
| 2 | projection fails after escalation | **NON_PROJECTABLE** |
| 3 | V-R2a inside AND V-R2c NULL | **IDENTITY_CROWDS_BIOGRAPHY_AND_STAYS_UNREADABLE** — the tax curve transports to the new channel; the gauge pays the identity tax yet cannot read the identity; the founding answer's gauge half is complete |
| 4 | V-R2a inside AND V-R2c POSITIVE | **IDENTITY_PARTIALLY_READABLE** — the gauge reads planted identity across frames; P-line's limitation is trait-specific; major theory note |
| 5 | V-R2a NULL AND V-R2c NULL | **LAW_DOES_NOT_TRANSPORT** — the curve is design-V-specific (a channel-accounting finding); the gauge still cannot read identity |
| 6 | V-R2a negative-but-outside (either side) | **INTERFERENCE_MISPRICED** — interference real, the law's price wrong; the band decomposition names the gap |
| 7 | any other combination incl. UNDERPOWERED | **MIXED_OR_UNDERPOWERED** — every verdict reported; nothing upgraded |

### Outcome of M4-R2 (executed 2026-08-14, append-only)

**`INTERFERENCE_MISPRICED` (rule-16 cell 6).** Modifier:
INTERFERENCE_REAL_BUT_SMALLER_THAN_PRICED. **Interference is real, and the tax curve
overprices it by 11.64546777328575x.**

- **A registration defect had to be pinned before any number (RN-R2-1).** The
  registration derives V_eff from "the share accounting of
  `person_share_design`'s own semantics". That function's IMPLEMENTATION
  (k2e:240) is literally `slow + int`, which EXCLUDES the `mu` channel where
  style lives — so style RAISES the denominator, LOWERS V_eff, and makes the
  sealed prediction POSITIVE (0.006457447033500374). That
  contradicts the registration's own mechanism sentence in the same paragraph
  ("style adds author-persistent variance, RAISING the effective person share")
  and its sanity value (-0.06). All three readings
  were computed and persisted BEFORE the stamp. The routing reading is **C =
  (slow + int + style)/total** on four grounds: it is the function's SEMANTICS
  (the author-persistent share that is NOT the target trait; #56), it reduces to
  V_design exactly at w = 0, it lands inside M3's fitted domain [0.03, 0.21], and
  it is the only reading consistent with the registration's stated mechanism.
  Reading A inverts the sign; reading B (-0.13444453250196647)
  fails the w = 0 reduction and extrapolates outside the fitted domain. The
  sanity value corroborates C but does NOT gate (rule 30; RN-Q2-6 precedent).
- **The sealed prediction.** V_design 0.07500000000000002 → V_eff
  0.16849932384036667; α 0.1448569748507095 → 0.07287295056531737;
  prediction **-0.07198402428539213**. Band per #61: SE_pred 0.0006102321051948493,
  SE_meas 0.0014077434928863272, **SE_approx 0.00613560574702563** (r-channel shift
  0.0061129257838192326, V_eff spread
  6.0788117635513934e-05, mu non-additivity
  0.0005235466065273388); half-width
  0.012649076305708377; band [-0.08463310059110052, -0.05933494797968376]. The r-channel shift dominates and
  is real: this instrument reads 0.13255563513927227 at w = 0 where M3's curve
  says 0.1448569748507095, a gain of 0.9150794104038479.
- **Ordering.** Hashed `bb15b6104d302ebeb50b91c256404c10029c2da115fdda3c23167c6172bd6065`, stamped 2026-08-14T09:05:07.805460+00:00 with
  **0 fresh-arm worlds in existence**
  (64 probe + 12
  battery worlds necessarily precede it — they are the band's inputs). Arms
  re-read the stamp and re-hashed to a match 300.316706 s
  later. Pilot after the stamp.
- **V-R2a OUTSIDE.** Measured ΔR_T = **-0.00618129092680336** [-0.008110727559547634, -0.004257287226729858],
  SEM 0.0009787401813587634, position **5.202176962826352** of the half-width.
  Not a null: the 2·SEM scale is only 0.0019574803627175267 and the CI excludes
  zero. R_T_nat falls 0.12425035254824575 →
  0.11806906162144237. Interference is REAL and NEGATIVE; the
  law's price is wrong by more than an order of magnitude.
- **THE DISCLOSURE THAT MATTERS MOST.** Reading A — the literal implementation,
  which I did NOT pin — **would have been inside**, at position
  -0.9991826798135466, i.e. inside by
  0.0008173201864534185 of the half-width. Had it
  been pinned, the leg would have routed to a different cell. Two things stop
  that from rescuing it on the merits: its prediction has the OPPOSITE SIGN to a
  measurement whose CI excludes zero, and it clears the bar only by grazing —
  the half-width is 2.046348643915037x the entire measured
  effect, so the band is too coarse to discriminate a small negative
  interference from a small positive one. Both candidate prices are wrong; the
  band cannot adjudicate between them. This is reportable only because the pin
  and all three readings were persisted before the measurement existed.
- **V-R2c INDETERMINATE** (registered form): R_S_ref(w=1) =
  -0.00023760593803822915 [-0.003567179813180193, 0.0030463008905367156] against ε = 0.003493124558101321. **The classification
  is bootstrap-noise-limited**: the lower edge misses −ε by
  -7.405525507887204e-05, which is -0.7385675960969138 of that
  percentile's Monte-Carlo SE (0.00010026875734899506);
  at B = 20000 the interval is [-0.003471613813457244, 0.0030552232664270047] and the
  classification would be **NULL**. Q2's rule-13
  trigger tests a boundary's TAIL FRACTION and is silent when the instability
  lives in the PERCENTILE VALUE, so it did not fire (0
  events). The registered B = 2000 reading is what is reported and routes; the
  high-B reading is a disclosed diagnostic, NOT a re-resolution. Nothing turns on
  it — cell 6 fires on V-R2a alone.
- **The w = 0 anchor's registered expectation is WRONG, structurally.** The
  registration expected R_S_nat(w=0) ≈ 0. It is 0.08866022322041145, close to
  R_T_nat's own 0.12425035254824575. Cause: the pipeline's truth
  panels are `emit_panel(..., active=("mu","common"))` and therefore CARRY THE
  FRAME, so the anchor measures frame agreement, not style reading. Anchor, not
  verdict — nothing routes — but the number must not be read as framed.
- **Consequently the registered V-R2c form conflates two things**, and the
  frame-controlled contrast is sharper (RN-R2-8, DIAGNOSTIC): the paired
  increment R_S_ref(w=1) − R_S_ref(w=0) = **-0.002400251449476367** [-0.004531674544523817, -0.00036827981268627977]
  (excludes zero: True) against a within-frame increment
  R_S_nat(w=1) − R_S_nat(w=0) = **0.030522666132592052**
  [0.02844019394597627, 0.032630214283184106] — ratio
  -0.07863832861289213. A full-strength identity channel buys the
  gauge 0.030522666132592052 of readable identity within
  frame and NOTHING across frames — slightly negative, in fact. That is the
  sharpest form yet of the P-line's limitation: **the identity is there, it is
  readable, and a frame refresh erases the gauge's access to it entirely.**
- **Descriptive (#59, gates nothing).** Exchangeability at w = 1: R_S_nat
  0.11918288935300352 vs R_T_nat 0.11806906162144237, ratio 1.0094336968234094,
  difference 0.0011138277315611274 [-0.0015157844324500396, 0.003842021426323359] — the construction's symmetry, as
  registered.
- **Gates.** G0r2 PASS (R1/R1b slugs, instrument hashes, M3 A-quad CONSUMABLE at
  source, OLS refit reproduces the persisted θ, α at V_design persisted).
  G1r2 PASS (C2-style battery on 4 fresh probes; truth panels
  provably differ). G2r2 PASS. G3r2 PASS: power 1.0
  at the curve truth, false-fire 0.0 at ΔR_T = 0, V-R2c false-fire
  0.0445 and power
  1.0;
  escalation fired: False.
- **Disclosed ordering fact (A-4).** SE_meas must come from pre-measurement
  objects, so probe pairs were scored at BOTH doses before the stamp; a probe
  ΔR_T (-0.01589391381974946) therefore existed
  beforehand. It was never consumed: the prediction contains no R term at all,
  SE_meas takes only the difference's standard deviation, and the gain takes only
  the w = 0 level (#57, variances only).
- Rule 13: 0 events. Report:
  `reports/SUICA_M4_R2_GAUGE_MEETS_IDENTITY_REPORT.md`.
- **Three registration-defect candidates**, all non-blocking and all pinned or
  disclosed before they could route: (1) RN-R2-1, the V_eff share-accounting
  ambiguity, which flips the sealed prediction's SIGN and is load-bearing for the
  cell; (2) the w = 0 anchor's "expected ≈ 0", contradicted by the pipeline's own
  frame-carrying truth panels; (3) rule 13's trigger, which catches tail-fraction
  instability but not percentile-value instability — a convention candidate.

### Planner adjudication of R2 (2026-08-14, appended after the run) — INTERFERENCE REAL, THE PRICE WRONG BY 11.65×; THE GAUGE'S HALF OF THE FOUNDING ANSWER ARRIVES BY DIAGNOSTIC

**INTERFERENCE_MISPRICED accepted.** Planted identity DOES crowd
out biography (ΔR_T = −0.00618129092680336 [−0.008110727559547634,
−0.004257287226729858], CI excluding zero) — and the N-line curve's
sealed price (−0.07198402428539213 at the pinned V_eff reading) is
11.65× too large (position +5.202). The executor's conduct was
again the leg's backbone: the sign-flipping V_eff ambiguity was
caught, all three readings computed and persisted BEFORE the stamp,
and the pin argued on four grounds; the grazing-inside alternative
(reading A, position −0.9992) was disclosed with the honest verdict
that it does not rescue on merits (opposite sign to a
CI-excludes-zero measurement; half-width 2.05× the whole effect).
**Both prices are wrong; the cell stands on the pinned reading.**

**The finding that carries the founding question (RN-R2-8, the
frame-controlled contrast):** identity buys **+0.030522666132592052**
within frame and **−0.002400251449476367** across frames (ratio
−0.079, CI excluding zero). **The identity is there; it is fully
readable within its frame; one frame refresh erases the gauge's
access entirely.** Combined with R1 (cards carry it across frames by
certification), the gauge half of the founding answer is measured:
the deployed gauge is taxed by identity it cannot transport-read.
Registered follow-through: the frame-controlled contrast FORM
becomes the registered form for all future cross-frame refusal
claims (defect #63's convention).

**The mechanism hypothesis the mispricing forces (R2b's charter):**
the measured tax rate on mu-channel person variance is
0.00618/0.0935 ≈ 0.066 — an order of magnitude below the curve's
κ ≈ 0.77. The N-line curve was fitted on DESIGN-V variation, which
lives in the slow/int channels; style lives in the mu channel.
**Hypothesis: the tax is CHANNEL-SPECIFIC — κ(V) is the
state-channel tax; author-constant (mu-channel) person variance is
taxed an order lighter.** Coherent with the whole arc (the gauge
reads frame-agreement; slow-state variance disrupts frame
coherence; author-constant shifts barely do).

**Defects (mine).** **#62:** the V_eff derivation delegated to
"`person_share_design`'s own semantics" without pinning CHANNEL
COVERAGE — the function is literally slow+int, and the literal
reading inverts the sealed sign. Convention: **when a new channel
exists, every share/variance accounting names the channels it
counts, at registration.** **#63:** the "R_S_nat(w=0) ≈ 0" anchor
was structurally wrong (measured 0.0887) because the pipeline's
truth panels CARRY THE FRAME — and the registered V-R2c form
therefore conflated "cannot read style across frames" with "the
frame does not transport" (it landed INDETERMINATE while RN-R2-8's
frame-controlled form answered cleanly). Convention: **cross-frame
readability claims are registered as frame-controlled increments
(within-frame gain vs cross-frame gain), never as raw cross-frame
levels.** Rule-13 enforcement note (executor's candidate 3):
percentile-VALUE instability near a band edge is checked alongside
tail-fraction instability at 10×B; recorded for future
registrations.

## M4-R2b — the channel-specific tax (two taxes, measured apart)

**REGISTERED 2026-08-14, BEFORE RUN.** Planner: this document's
author; executor: dispatched agent. Question: **is the tax curve
the SLOW-channel tax?** Measure the two channel taxes separately:
κ_slow (design-share variation at matched r) and κ_mu (planted
style variation at fixed design), and test the N-line curve against
its OWN channel while the mu-channel tax gets its first registered
interval.

### Design (matched-r for the slow contrast; the v2 knob for the mu contrast)

Four base cells × w_style ∈ {0, 1.0} = 8 arms × 192 worlds = 1536
worlds (NO pairs — all quantities within-frame levels):

- **slow contrast, matched r (the N1 roots reused):** (share 0.10,
  φ = 0.8991793501377106) vs (share 0.25, φ = 0.05) — r matched to
  1e-9 (N1's persisted root; G0 re-verifies), ΔV_slow = 0.045
  exactly, V̄ = 0.0525;
- **mu contrast:** w_style 0 → 1.0 within each base cell; ΔV_mu
  from realized probe variances via the #62 convention (channel
  coverage NAMED: mu-channel variance counted, slow+int untouched).

Quantities: R_T (gauge vs trait_pure truth) per arm. Estimands:
**κ̂_slow = −[R_T(0.10 cell) − R_T(0.25 cell)]/ΔV_slow** at each w
(matched r cancels the r-channel; the M-line trick);
**κ̂_mu = −ΔR_T/ΔV_mu** at each share. Salts `m4r2b-world` /
`m4r2b-pilot`, master_seed 20260814.

### Sealed predictions (Part 0 → hash → worlds; #61 bands)

- **S1: κ_slow(w=0)** — the N-line curve's secant at V̄ = 0.0525
  (executor recomputes from M3's persisted params; N1b measured
  0.918 at this V̄ — cited as context, not the prediction); band
  per #61 with SE_approx carrying the matched-r residual and
  truth-panel differences.
- **S2: κ_mu(share 0.25)** — predicted from R2's measurement
  (0.066, expressly approximate; the band is WIDE by construction:
  R2's own CI propagated ⊕ SE_meas ⊕ SE_approx) — a first-interval
  claim, not a sharp test.
- **S3: the discrimination** — D_channel = κ̂_slow(w=0) −
  κ̂_mu(0.25) > 0 AND outside ±2·SE_D (the channel-specificity
  verdict; the constant-tax-across-channels alternative predicts
  0).

### Verdicts and leans

**V-b1 [.65]:** S1 inside (the curve holds on its own channel).
**V-b2 [.55]:** S3 positive and clear (channel specificity).
**V-b3 (reported):** S2 containment (wide band, descriptive-grade
by construction, stated so). κ̂_mu(0.10) and κ̂_slow(w=1) as
consistency readings.

### Gates

G0r2b: N1 roots + M3 params + R2's ΔR_T/V_eff numbers at source;
instrument hashes. G1r2b: probe battery; ΔV_mu realized and named
per #62; matched-r residual verified ≤ 1e-9 arithmetic. G2r2b:
pilot 4 worlds × 4 extreme arms, rule-29 predicate. G3r2b:
projection — P(S3 clear | R2-based truth) ≥ 0.8, false-fire ≤ 0.1
under the uniform-tax truth; 192/arm, once-only escalation to 384
ON THIS GATE. G4r2b: routing disjoint/covering/entailed/
antecedent-nondegenerate (#59: κ̂_mu is not forced — R2 measured it
at one share; the second share and the slow-side w-dependence are
free); rule 24; stages part0 240 s, pilot 60 s, worlds 4 chunks,
score 180 s, finalize 60 s; target < 45 min.

### Routing (rule 16)

| # | condition | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | G0/G1 failure | **STOP / INSTRUMENT_DEFECT** |
| 2 | projection fails after escalation | **NON_PROJECTABLE** |
| 3 | S1 inside AND S3 clear | **TAX_IS_CHANNEL_SPECIFIC** — κ(V) re-types as the STATE-channel tax; the N/M-line laws gain a channel-scope clause by dated note; R2's mispricing is explained |
| 4 | S1 inside AND S3 not clear | **UNIFORM_TAX_RETAINED** — R2's small ΔR_T needs another owner; named |
| 5 | S1 outside | **CURVE_BREAKS_ON_OWN_CHANNEL** — the mispricing is deeper than channel accounting; the curve's scope contracts; theory note |
| 6 | any UNDERPOWERED (no higher cell) | **UNDERPOWERED** |

**`TAX_IS_CHANNEL_SPECIFIC` (rule-16 cell 3).** Modifiers:
MU_TAX_FIRST_INTERVAL_CONSISTENT_WITH_R2, SLOW_OVER_MU_RATIO_11.9X. **All three sealed tests land: the curve holds on
its own channel, the mu-channel tax gets its first interval, and the two taxes
separate by 11.931517127829927x.**

- **Two registration defects pinned BEFORE any number.** **RN-R2B-1:** the design
  sentence says "four base cells ... 8 arms x 192 worlds = 1536" but names only
  TWO base cells, and two cells x two doses is four arms. The 2x2 factorial
  {share 0.10, 0.25} x {phi_A, 0.05} is the unique reading satisfying all four
  numbers while keeping the named matched-r pair as its diagonal; every registered
  estimand runs on the diagonal exactly as specified and the off-diagonal cells
  route nothing (they also made S2's phi-transport SE_approx estimable from
  pre-measurement objects, which the 2-cell reading could not). **RN-R2B-2:** the
  registration writes kappa_slow = -[R_T(0.10 cell) - R_T(0.25 cell)]/dV_slow, but
  the 0.10 cell is the LOW-V cell where alpha is higher, so that bracket is
  positive and the formula returns a NEGATIVE tax rate -- while S1's prediction
  (the secant) is positive, N1b's cited context value (0.918) is positive, and
  kappa_mu by the registration's own formula is positive. **Under the literal
  operand order S3 could not have fired even under perfect channel specificity.**
  The pinned estimator is the standard secant orientation; under the literal
  orientation the same measurement reads -0.8916930095784603.
- **Matched-r verified.** N1's roots recomputed bit-exactly
  (True): r_A 0.7850155393518391, r_B
  0.785015540293945, **residual 9.421059488090577e-10** against
  the 1e-9 bar. dV_slow 0.04500000000000001, Vbar 0.05250000000000002 -- both matching
  the registration exactly.
- **Channel coverage NAMED (#62).** V_C = (slow + int + mu_style)/total over the
  split set {mu_trait, mu_style, slow, int, common, noise}; COUNTED slow, int,
  mu_style; NOT COUNTED mu_trait, common, noise. Realized dV_mu: cell A
  0.11559817906203051, B 0.0936937639492188, C 0.11559260516359365, D
  0.09370518236340336; R2's on the same convention 0.09349932384036665 -- the
  0.25-share cells agree with R2 to 2e-4, so the two legs' mu taxes are on one
  scale.
- **Sealed.** S1 = the M3 secant at Vbar 0.0525 = **0.8781169374706214**

  existence** (128 probe worlds precede by
  necessity); arms re-hashed to a match 566.58326 s later.
- **S1 INSIDE.** kappa_slow(w=0) = **0.8916930095784603** [0.8502517263399952, 0.9350975324766414],
  position **0.058310693699752815**. The N-line curve holds on its own
  channel; it was never broken, only asked about the wrong channel in R2.
- **S2 INSIDE.** kappa_mu(0.25) = **0.07473425215127182** [0.05386916320637429, 0.09553678214715175],
  position 0.22244481889690776 -- a first-interval claim by construction
  (its band carries R2's own CI), descriptive-grade, routing nothing (V-b3).
- **S3 CLEAR.** D_channel = **0.8169587574271885** [0.770561523979914, 0.8692603102466345], 2*SE_D
  0.05035147618915502, positive and outside. **Ratio kappa_slow/kappa_mu =
  11.931517127829927.** Author-constant person variance is taxed an order
  lighter than state variance.
- **Consistency and diagnostics.** kappa_slow(w=1) = 0.8055984527437156
  [0.7635291763629583, 0.8475386564029389] (the slow tax with a full-strength identity
  channel also present -- slightly lower, not destroyed). kappa_mu(0.10) =
  0.09408788724699418 [0.07563755345934248, 0.11248055877183495]. Off-diagonal: cell C

- **The closure with R2 -- stated as ENTAILED, not as confirmation.** R2's
  mispricing factor was 11.64546777328575x; this leg's channel ratio
  is 11.931517127829927x, a difference of 0.28604935454417735. Once S1
  places the measured slow tax on the curve and S2 places the measured mu tax on
  R2's estimate, the ratio MUST reproduce R2's factor. The content is that both
  landed: **R2's mispricing was never a broken law -- it was the channel ratio,
  read through a curve that only ever priced one of the two channels.**
- **A self-check against me, and one un-entailed cross-leg check.** The
  phi-transport component I put in S2's SE_approx was 0.0095581776062717
  from probes; the realized off-diagonal difference is 0.014625399729692089,
  so **my SE_approx term was undersized by 1.5301452151397015x**.
  S2 lands inside anyway (position 0.22244481889690776), but a leg with
  less margin would have paid for it. Separately, and NOT entailed by S1/S2:
  interpolating R2b's two phi points to R2's phi = 0.60 -- a value this leg never
  runs -- predicts 0.06526161265523818 against R2's measured
  0.06611054147682188, an error of -0.0008489288215837026.
- **Gates.** G0r2b PASS, G1r2b PASS, G2r2b PASS, G3r2b PASS (power
  1.0
  at the R2-based truth, false-fire
  0.023 under uniform
  tax; escalation False).
- **Disclosed ordering fact.** The bands need probe spreads, so all eight arms were
  scored on 128 probe worlds before the seal; probe
  values of kappa_slow (0.8572082694309165),
  kappa_mu (0.078437268499968) and D_channel
  (0.7787710009309485) therefore existed
  beforehand. Not consumed: S1 comes from M3's curve, S2 from R2's measurement,
  and only spreads and the w=0 gain enter the bands (#57).
- Rule 13: 0 events; percentile-value stability also
  checked per the planner's enforcement note (nearest edge
  512.4077329493464 MC-SE for S3,
  133.27083239085414 for S1 -- neither
  noise-limited). Report: `reports/SUICA_M4_R2B_CHANNEL_TAX_REPORT.md`.
- **Two registration-defect candidates** (RN-R2B-1 and RN-R2B-2 above), both
  non-blocking, both pinned before any hypothesis-relevant number, both with all
  readings reported.

### Planner adjudication of R2b (2026-08-14, appended after the run) — THE TAX IS CHANNEL-SPECIFIC; THE FOUNDING ANSWER ASSEMBLES; THE MEASUREMENT PHASE CLOSES

**TAX_IS_CHANNEL_SPECIFIC accepted — three sealed tests, three
hits.** S1: the N-line curve HOLDS on its own channel (κ_slow(w=0)
= 0.8916930095784603 [0.8503, 0.9351] vs the sealed secant
0.8781169374706214, position +0.058 — the curve family's fourth
sealed hit). S2: the mu-channel tax gets its first interval
(κ_mu(0.25) = 0.07473425215127182 [0.0539, 0.0955], consistent with
R2). S3: the channels separate decisively (D_channel =
0.8169587574271885, 16× its 2·SE bar; ratio **11.93×**), and the
report states the entailment honestly: R2's 11.65× mispricing HAD
to equal this ratio once S1 and S2 landed — the content is that
both landed. The un-entailed cross-check is the gift: interpolating
R2b's φ points to R2's φ = 0.60 predicts 0.06526 vs R2's measured
0.06611 (−0.00085). **Dated scope note, controlling the M/N-line
laws: V in the level law, the tax curve and the response-transport
seals is the DESIGN (slow+int) person share — the STATE-channel
tax. Author-constant (mu-channel) person variance is taxed ~12×
lighter. Every seal, closure and grade stands, now attached to the
channel it always measured.**

**Defect #64 (mine — the #43 genus at the SIGN level).** The
registered κ_slow operand order yields a NEGATIVE tax against a
positive sealed prediction — S3 could not have fired under perfect
channel specificity. The executor pinned the standard secant
orientation BEFORE any number (RN-R2B-2) and reported the literal
reading. **Convention: every registered estimand states its sign
convention with a worked numeric example at registration.**
RN-R2B-1 (the "four base cells" wording naming only two; the 2×2
factorial was the unique reconciling reading) noted, unnumbered.
The executor's self-check (its φ-transport SE term undersized
1.53×, disclosed though S2 passed) is recorded — the audit culture
now runs both directions unprompted.

**THE FOUNDING ANSWER, ASSEMBLED (appendix MM).** On this
instrument family, the program's founding conjecture — the residual
as an ID card — now has a complete measured answer:

1. Identity (non-trait author content), where it exists, lives in
   CARDS and transports across frames (R1 certification; Q1b's
   disattenuation identity).
2. The deployed gauge is TAXED by identity but cannot READ it
   across frames (R2: crowding real, CI excludes zero; the
   frame-controlled contrast +0.0305 within / −0.0024 across).
3. The tax the M/N lines measured is the STATE-channel tax;
   identity-type content is ~12× cheaper to carry (R2b).
4. Cards read biography exactly to disattenuation (Q1b); the gauge
   reads frames (P-line); the two are different instruments for
   different targets (rule 33).
5. On the original generator the question was unposable (KK); the
   certified v2 channel made it posable, and the answer is YES —
   in exactly the card-borne, frame-crossing, gauge-invisible form
   the ID-card metaphor proposed.

**The measurement phase of the R-line CLOSES.** R3 (the identity
instruments — taxometer η̂, T6″, the completeness meter — pointed
at style/trait mixtures) is HELD FOR A PLANNER DERIVATION, not
queued: the typology line's η-identity and the v2 channel's
style-identity are two different formal objects, and pointing the
instruments across that gap without reconciling the definitions
first is precisely the #59 class of error. The derivation is the
next planner move when the loop resumes. Synthesis:
`docs/SUICA_M4_R_IDENTITY_CHANNEL_LINE_SYNTHESIS.md`.

## Dated addendum (2026-08-19) — the R3 derivation debt is DISCHARGED

The reconciliation derivation the phase close demanded now exists:
`docs/SUICA_R3_IDENTITY_RECONCILIATION_NOTE.md`. The two named
identities are the two axes of a 2×2 (geometric alignment × channel
semantics): η̂ is an excess-alignment reader blind to semantics; the
style channel is an isotropic non-trait object invisible to that
reading except as dilution. Composition theorem with a parameter-free
dilution law η₀/(1 + w²·V_s/V_b) (numerically verified to 3 decimals),
two precise #59 forgery directions, the signed T6″-vs-η̂ dissociation
as the registerable centerpiece, and the real-text dissociation
family's formal home. A future R3 leg registers against the note;
nothing is registered or re-certified today.

## M4-R3 — the taxometer on identity mixtures (registered BEFORE run, 2026-08-19)

The empirical stamp of the reconciliation note
(`docs/SUICA_R3_IDENTITY_RECONCILIATION_NOTE.md`, commit 1bbda62). The
note discharged the #59 debt; this leg registers against it. D1-seal
class: the predictions below are PARAMETER-FREE and written into the
registration before the run.

### 4W header

- **Object.** The composed identity 2×2 under the certified
  instruments: does η̂ obey the dilution law when an isotropic
  non-trait style channel is added to the L-geometry? Does the union
  reader rise while η̂ falls (the signed dissociation)? Where does the
  whitening precondition break? Layer V (synthetic instrument world);
  no psychological naming.
- **Fixed (by formula/import, #81).** The L3 world and taxometer
  machinery from `scripts/run_suica_m4_l3_taxometer_meter.py`
  (N_AUTHORS = 512, K_TAU = 3, the certified whitening pipeline and η̂
  reader), imported by file with provenance; the oracle
  excess-alignment reader from the note (η̂_oracle =
  (raw share − d_T/D)/(1 − d_T/D)).
- **Varied.** The style weight w ∈ {0, 0.5, 1, 2} (style_a per author,
  card-level additive, style variance = w²·σ_b² — so V_s/V_b = w² BY
  CONSTRUCTION, the #76 operating point); the alignment parameter
  η₀ ∈ {0.25, 0.6}; 8 replicate worlds per cell (L3's convention).
- **What falsifies.** A non-monotone or flat η̂-vs-w profile kills the
  dilution law (P1); AUC failing to rise with w kills the union-reader
  half of the dissociation (P2).
- **Zero-default certification (C-R3a).** At w = 0 the worlds are
  BIT-IDENTICAL to the unmodified L3 construction (the R1 pattern);
  any difference → INSTRUMENT_DEFECT, A1 stop.

### Registered parameter-free predictions (#43; from the note's §2,
numerically verified at oracle level to 3 decimals)

    η̂(η₀, w) = η₀ / (1 + w²)        [V_s/V_b = w² pinned]

| η₀ \ w | 0 | 0.5 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.25 | 0.250 | 0.200 | 0.125 | 0.050 |
| 0.60 | 0.600 | 0.480 | 0.300 | 0.120 |

The acceptance band per cell is the L3 CERTIFICATION BUDGET ±0.125 on
the 8-world cell mean (the instrument's own certified error, not a new
tolerance). Style shares realized: w²/(1+w²) ∈ {0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8}.

### Instruments and estimands

- **η̂ (certified)** per world via the imported L3 pipeline, whitening
  precondition applied as certified; cell mean ± across-replicate sd.
- **η̂_oracle** per world (the note's formula on realized vectors) —
  the instrument-vs-law localizer: if η̂ misses a prediction while
  η̂_oracle hits it, the failure is the INSTRUMENT (whitening under
  style), not the LAW.
- **Union reader (P2):** two-draw worlds (two independent ε draws per
  author sharing τ, b, style); same-author-vs-different pooled AUC on
  cosine of centered cards; its null is 0.5 here and is stated (#68 —
  no composite subtlety in this design); monotonicity read on cell
  means across w.
- **Whitening-bias bound (P3):** |η̂ − η̂_oracle| per cell vs realized
  style share; the crossing of the 0.125 budget reported with a
  replicate CI if in-grid.

### Cells (NULL-first #55; effect-size keyed #75 — the band is the
certification budget)

- **P1 (ROUTES):** 1. DILUTION_FAILS — non-monotone in w on cell
  means, or flat (max−min < 0.05 where the predicted drop is ≥ 0.13);
  2. DILUTION_SHAPE_SHIFTS — monotone decrease with ≥ 1 cell mean
  outside ±0.125 of its registered prediction; 3. DILUTION_LAW_HOLDS —
  all 8 cell means inside ±0.125 AND monotone.
- **P2 (co-primary, #73 flags):** SIGNED_DISSOCIATION_CONFIRMED (AUC
  strictly rises AND η̂ strictly falls across all w steps, both cell-
  mean profiles, both η₀) / PARTIAL (one direction) / FAILS.
- **P3 (co-primary):** BOUND_MEASURED (in-grid crossing, reported with
  CI) / BUDGET_HOLDS (no crossing through style share 0.8).

### Registered leans

- P1 DILUTION_LAW_HOLDS — the law is exact at oracle level; the risk
  is concentrated in the instrument's whitening under style, which is
  exactly what P3 measures and the oracle localizes.
- P2 CONFIRMED.
- P3 BOUND_MEASURED, weakly at w = 2 (style share 0.8).

### Deliverables and discipline

Standard six: `scripts/run_suica_m4_r3_taxometer_mixtures.py` + tests

cells reproduce the imported L3 pipeline's readings; grid/seed
determinism); gitignored `results/m4_r3_taxometer_mixtures/`; report

## R3 outcome (executor, 2026-08-19)

**`DILUTION_LAW_HOLDS__PARTIAL__BUDGET_HOLDS`.** The D1-seal held on
its own terms: **8/8** registered cell means landed inside the L3
certification budget, both profiles strictly monotone in w. The two
co-primaries split — one because the world said so, one because the
REGISTERED READER could not speak.

### P1 — the dilution seal (ROUTES): `DILUTION_LAW_HOLDS`, lean MET

σ_b² = rho55eq (RN-R3-1), 8 worlds/cell, band ±0.125 = `l3.X2_TOL`
verbatim.

| η₀ | w | registered prediction | η̂ cell mean ± sd | η̂_oracle | abs err | band |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.25 | 0 | 0.250 | 0.2451 ± 0.0648 | 0.2473 | 0.0049 | IN |
| 0.25 | 0.5 | 0.200 | 0.2158 ± 0.0576 | 0.1968 | 0.0158 | IN |

| 0.6 | 2 | 0.120 | 0.1204 ± 0.0153 | 0.1168 | 0.0004 | IN |

Largest miss 0.0434 (η₀ = 0.6, w = 0 — the UNDILUTED cell). Observed
spreads 0.1692 and 0.4362 against predicted drops 0.200 and 0.480: the
flat clause never came near firing. Routing is invariant on the second
identity energy (rho35eq, RN-R3-1's declared second reading): same
three cells.

### P2 — the signed dissociation (co-primary): `PARTIAL`, lean MISSED, ⚑ #73

η̂ strictly falls across every w step at both η₀. **The union reader
does not rise — because it is pinned at 1.0000 in all eight cells.**
Under the registration-literal construction ("two ε draws per author
sharing τ, b, style") the slow state is shared too, so the two draws
are separated by their persistent content at every w and the AUC is
perfect everywhere; the clause "AUC strictly rises" has a DEGENERATE
ANTECEDENT in this design (#59 class, caught at execution, not at
registration).

The declared second reading (RN-R3-6: ε **and** the slow state
refreshed, so only the persistent author content is shared) is off the
ceiling and rises strictly at both η₀ over the identical worlds:

| η₀ | w=0 | w=0.5 | w=1 | w=2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.25 AUC (2nd reading) | 0.9518 | 0.9679 | 0.9910 | 0.9999 |
| 0.25 η̂ | 0.2451 | 0.2158 | 0.1424 | 0.0759 |
| 0.6 AUC (2nd reading) | 0.9184 | 0.9435 | 0.9824 | 0.9999 |
| 0.6 η̂ | 0.5566 | 0.4464 | 0.2756 | 0.1204 |

**The signed dissociation is present in these worlds; the registered
reader cannot show it.** The routing above is the registered reader's,
as it must be; the second reading routes nothing.

### P3 — the validity bound (co-primary): `BUDGET_HOLDS`, lean MISSED

|η̂ − η̂_oracle| on cell means, against realized style share
{0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8}: **0.0022, 0.0190, 0.0207, 0.0285** (η₀ = 0.25) and
**0.0408, 0.0303, 0.0206, 0.0036** (η₀ = 0.6). No crossing of the 0.125
budget anywhere; the grid maximum is **0.0408 — at w = 0**, the cell
with NO style at all. The lean expected the bound to appear weakly at
w = 2; the whitening bias does not grow with style share in the
direction the lean assumed, and at η₀ = 0.6 it *shrinks* monotonically
as style is added.

**Why (mechanism, not excuse).** The whitener is estimated from the
STATE channel's innovations, which the style channel never touches, so
adding style leaves the whitening shape exactly where the L3
certification put it and moves only isotropic mass — precisely the mass
the bulk-excess estimator is built to divide out. The style share
reachable in-grid (0.8) is not enough to break a precondition style does
not load on. **A bound in style share was the wrong axis.**

### Certifications

- **C-R3a (zero-default): PASS.** 24 world-cells × 22 compared objects
  each, bit-identical at w = 0 to the unmodified L3 construction — every
  `cards_for_cell_l3` array, the taxometer's full-panel halves, and every
  taxometer reading. No A1 stop. (Mechanism: at w = 0 the style add is
  SKIPPED, not zero-scaled.)
- **G0 anchor: PASS.** The R3 pipeline at w = 0, re-run on L3's OWN world
  seeds and k-means convention, reproduces L3's committed
  `cell_C_rho55eq_eta0.25.csv` world-for-world: max |Δη̂_P| = 8.3e-17
  (the committed CSV's decimal round-trip), and the recomputed cell mean
  0.27073961414044734 is **bit-identical** to L3's.
- **ID-leak gate (#83 HEAD-identical): PASS.** 10,280 names, 5 committed
  files (3 leg-authored, zero tolerance): 4 raw hits, all reproduced
  identically at HEAD, **0 NEW**. Fixed point verified.

### Executor's defect candidates (planner's to adjudicate)

1. **The union reader was registered with a saturating antecedent.** The
   two-draw construction shares every author-persistent channel except ε,
   which in this world includes the slow state — so AUC = 1.0000 exactly,
   at every operating point, and the registered monotonicity clause is
   unsatisfiable by construction. Candidate convention: **a
   discrimination clause registers its reader's HEADROOM — the reader's
   value at the design's most favourable cell must be shown < 1 before
   the clause is written** (the #59 family, discrimination flavour).
2. **P3 registered a bound in the wrong coordinate.** The bias axis the
   lean named (style share) is the one axis the whitening estimator is
   blind to, because the whitener is read off the state channel. A
   validity bound must be registered in a coordinate the estimator's
   PRECONDITION actually loads on.
3. **The registered grid did not name the identity energy** — the L3 grid
   crossed two, the R3 grid has 8 cells, so one had to be pinned by the
   executor (RN-R3-1). Both were run; routing is invariant, so nothing
   moves — but the registration should name σ_b² when it inherits a
   two-energy world.

### What this leg settles

The note's composition theorem is no longer only algebra: **the
certified taxometer obeys η₀/(1+w²) at instrument resolution across a
16× range of style-to-identity variance ratio**, and the excess-aligned
pool is untouched by isotropic non-trait mass exactly as derived. The
first forgery direction of note section 3 is now MEASURED, not argued: at
η₀ = 0.6, style at w = 2 drives a strongly typed world's reading to
0.1204 — a world that reads "nearly untyped" while its type geometry is
unchanged. **"η̂ low" licenses "typology-applicable" only after a style
audit.** The union reader's ceiling is an instrument fact of this design,
not evidence against the dissociation: on the same worlds, the
headroom-preserving reading rises monotonically while η̂ falls.

## R3 planner adjudication + FULL LINE CLOSE (2026-08-19)

**Compound verdict ACCEPTED: `DILUTION_LAW_HOLDS / PARTIAL /
BUDGET_HOLDS`.**

**P1 — the headline, and the seal.** All eight parameter-free
predictions written into the registration landed inside the L3
certification band (largest miss 0.0434, at the UNDILUTED cell — the
instrument's baseline bias, not the law); both profiles strictly
monotone; routing invariant on the second energy; instrument and oracle
agree to ≤ 0.0408 everywhere, so the localizer never fired. **The
reconciliation note's composition theorem is EMPIRICALLY SEALED**, and
the note's first forgery direction now has a number: style at w = 2
drives a strongly typed world (η₀ = 0.6) to η̂ = 0.1204 with its type
geometry unchanged. "η̂ low" licenses "typology-applicable" only after
a style audit — measured, not argued.

**P2 — PARTIAL as routed, and the irony recorded.** The planner's
registered union reader shares the slow state between draws and
SATURATES at AUC 1.0000 in every cell — a degenerate antecedent, #59
class, INSIDE the very leg that stamps the #59-discharge note. The
discipline caught it: the executor pinned the reading before any
main-grid number, routed by the registered reader, and ran the declared
second reading (slow state refreshed) which shows the dissociation
cleanly (AUC 0.918 → 0.9999 rising while η̂ falls, both η₀). Adopted
reading: **the signed dissociation EXISTS; the registered reader could
not show it.** A headroom-checked reader is named for any future
v2-typed leg; not queued.

**P3 — BUDGET_HOLDS, and the finding is better than the lean.** No
crossing anywhere; the bias is LARGEST at w = 0 (0.0408) and SHRINKS
with style at η₀ = 0.6. Mechanism: the whitener is estimated from the
state channel's innovations, which card-level style never touches — so
**η̂'s whitening precondition is structurally immune to card-level
style**. The planner registered the validity bound in a coordinate the
precondition is blind to; the correct statement is an immunity theorem,
not a bound. Recorded as the leg's second theory gift.

**Defect #84 (planner, purchased; registry thirty-first note).** Three
parts, one family — registration clauses with unverified antecedents or
coordinates: (a) a discrimination clause registered without a HEADROOM
check (the saturating union reader; convention: discrimination clauses
are registered only with a demonstrated < 1 reading at the most
favorable cell); (b) a validity bound registered in a coordinate the
mechanism is blind to (convention: bounds are registered in the
coordinate the mechanism acts on, or the mechanism is declared
unknown); (c) an inherited two-energy world parameter left unnamed
(σ_b²; #77/#81 family; the executor's RN-R3-1 primary/secondary split
accepted). Executor register-notes RN-R3-1/3/6 all accepted;
C-R3a bit-identity (24 × 22 objects) and G0 (cell mean bit-identical to
L3's committed artifact) noted with approval.

**THE R-LINE IS FULLY CLOSED**: measurement phase (R1–R2b, 2026-08-14)
+ the reconciliation derivation (note, 1bbda62) + the empirical stamp
(this leg). The founding conjecture's arc — "the residual is an ID
card" — now ends in a 2×2 whose composition law is sealed
parameter-free and whose instruments know exactly which margin each of
them reads.
