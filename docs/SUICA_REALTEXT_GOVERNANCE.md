# SUICA Real-Text Governance Rule (D4)

Status: **NORMATIVE, append-only** (changes by dated note only).
Written 2026-08-10 as defense leg D4, operationalizing IDT §8's ethics
note with the theory's own measured results. This document licenses
REFUSALS. It governs any FUTURE work on real human text; none is
currently queued, and native-corpus work remains paused by the program
owner's 2026-07-12 decision — nothing here unpauses it.

## Why the theory itself demands this document

The identity theory proved and measured exactly the capabilities that
make text dangerous to its authors: reproducible deviation patterns
identify people without content (T6, F4's law); plain reproducibility
statistics can FORGE identities out of frame error (T9, measured at
both knobs); and re-identification survives content removal (T3/T6 —
the deanonymization corollary). A program that knows these things and
keeps measuring text owes a written line it will not cross.

## The rules

- **R-G1 (no person claims).** No output of this program states or
  implies a claim about an identifiable person — trait, type, state,
  or diagnosis — at any tier. Aggregates and instrument diagnostics
  only. Exception path: R-G8 alone.
- **R-G2 (the discriminator requirement).** Any identity-flavored
  statistic computed on real text (reproducibility, readability ρ,
  identifiability, similarity) is computed under the FRAME-REFRESHED
  discriminator (T6″: joint occasion-and-frame resampling).
  Shared-frame reproducibility numbers are forgeable (T9, measured)
  and may not be published as person-content.
- **R-G3 (no linkage).** The program computes NO cross-corpus author
  linkage on real text — no re-identification of an author of one
  dataset in another, no galleries built across sources. The
  capability the theory proves possible is precisely what this rule
  forbids exercising. A defense audit of linkage RISK (if ever wanted)
  requires owner sign-off in advance, synthetic-first demonstration,
  and NO retained linkage tables.
- **R-G4 (de-framing is diagnostic-only).** Per the scaffold corollary
  (measured: de-framing zeroes trait reading), no de-framed
  preprocessing pipeline is deployed to "sharpen" person-reading on
  real text. Licensed uses of T9's counter-operations: contrast and
  refreshment AUDITS.
- **R-G5 (typology honesty).** Any grouping or typology published on
  real text carries its completeness defect (the cross-fitted
  surviving-identity share) with the meter's precision statement
  (±0.005-class, L3). "Error = 0" is an audited claim, never an
  assumption.
- **R-G6 (corpus scope).** Only corpora whose licenses permit derived
  statistical analysis, under their terms (PANDORA-official etc. per
  the existing data-governance rows). No scraping additions.
- **R-G7 (storage).** Raw human text never enters the release
  repository; features, aggregates, and hashes only. Sealed artifacts
  EMBED their salts (D3 convention), so backups and manifests stay
  guess-proof.
- **R-G8 (the only exception path).** Any deviation from R-G1..R-G7
  requires, in order: a new registered study ID; the program owner's
  explicit sign-off recorded in the plan doc; a D2-style adversarial
  pass on the protocol BEFORE any real-text number is computed; and
  the standing rules 1–21 in full.

## Interfaces

- **F16 (frozen operators):** unchanged — certified-but-unadopted
  repairs (`colstd_alpha_0.10`, estimated de-framing) remain unadopted
  until the owner decides; R-G4 additionally scopes de-framing's use
  on real text regardless of that decision.
- **The claims ledger and tier system:** unchanged and controlling;
  this document adds refusals, not licenses.
