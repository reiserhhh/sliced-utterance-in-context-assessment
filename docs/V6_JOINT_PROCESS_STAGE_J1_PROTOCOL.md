# SUICA V6 Joint-Process Stage J1: Protocol

## Correction to the old dynamic endpoint

This stage does not ask whether a person repeats the same narrative across days
or retains a constant score. Natural selection of topic, community, situation,
and transition is part of the object under study. The old four-subepoch
condition-matched V1 endpoint remains archived as a narrow identifiability
refusal, not a mainline gate.

## Measurement object

For author `u`, natural event `i`, representation `m`, and epoch `e`:

\[
Z_{ui}^{m}=(A_{ui}, X_{ui}^{m}), \qquad
\mathcal P_{u,e}^{m}=
\mathcal L\!\left((Z_{ui}^{m},\Delta t_{ui})_{i\in e}\mid(O_{ui})_{i\in e}\right).
\]

`A` is an author-selected, independently observed pre-text field when one is
available (for PANDORA: subreddit). `X` is a frozen text representation.
`O` contains only externally imposed expression opportunities. If `A` is
inferred from the same text used to produce `X`, the system does not claim to
separate them; it reports their joint object only.

The two planned numerical summaries are:

\[
\mu_{u,e}=E[w(O)\phi(Z)], \qquad
\Gamma_{u,e}=E[w(O_i,O_{i+1},\Delta t_i)\phi(Z_i)\otimes\phi(Z_{i+1})].
\]

The weight `w` may balance only documented global opportunity. It must not
erase author-selected community, topic, situation, voluntary length, or
spontaneous expression format.

## J1 frozen estimator

J1 begins with a deliberately auditable **linear-kernel mean embedding**. For
each technical view it averages: (a) a frozen text SVD representation, (b) a
fixed hash encoding of the observed selection field, and (c) ordered
within-block source, successor, and time-gap distributions. Component vectors
are L2-normalized only when comparing author geometries, then concatenated as
the joint view vector. This is the linear feature-map case of the formula
above, not an assertion that a nonlinear latent factor has been identified.

The vocabulary and SVD fit on the author-disjoint discovery cohort only. J1
evaluates calibrated and confirmation cohorts without labels. Its only
promotion is to a reproducible **natural joint-process geometry** when both
independent text representations exceed the frozen same-author AUC and
randomization conditions and their confirmation geometries correlate above the
predeclared floor. It cannot promote a personality construct. The J1
`transition_joint` is still a first-order pair summary: it retains source and
successor marginals. A separate centred cross-covariance operator and
within-block order-shuffle null are required before asserting that ordering
itself contributes information.

## J0 before all endpoint work

1. A frozen synthetic calibration picks the smallest **per-view**
   event/transition support pair capable of estimating the declared
   kernel-mean process object in its named synthetic world. It must pass a
   null world plus weak and moderate author-conditioned worlds.
2. PANDORA J0 reads only author, timestamp, subreddit, body length, and a
   conservative explicit personality-report leakage guard. It neither fits a
   text representation nor reads labels or interprets retained text content.
3. J1 uses two disjoint technical views made of non-overlapping consecutive
   three-event blocks. J0 therefore inflates the per-view calibration support
   to the required total before counting eligible authors. The confirmation
   cohort requires at least 300 eligible authors after that inflation.
4. PANDORA has no independently observed global opportunity variable in this
   raw schema. J0 can therefore license only the joint process; it cannot
   license conditional-expression or causal separation.

## Planned endpoint battery after J0

- J1: independent representation geometry of author/document kernel means.
- J2: selection-expression coupling against author-within opportunity-stratum
  pairing nulls, retaining both marginals.
- J3: ordered adjacent transition geometry versus non-adjacent successor nulls
  matched only on documented external opportunity and time-gap bin.
- J4: calendar variation versus technical within-period resampling.
- J5: held-out next-text distribution gain from natural author history.

All exact effect thresholds beyond J0 are selected on calibration data and
frozen before confirmation data are opened. No Big5, MBTI, clinical, or market
labels may enter this stage.

## Explicit nonclaims

Passing J1--J5 would not prove personality, clinical state, causal topic
effects, cross-language equivalence, cross-domain portability, or a stable
human essence. It would only support an estimable, representation-bounded
natural text-process geometry.
