# SUICA v0.2.0 V7 Technical Lockbox

Status: sealed by the annotated `v0.2.0` tag and
`release/v0.2.0/LOCKBOX_MANIFEST.json`.

## What is frozen

Version 0.2.0 freezes the executable V7 technical object

\[
\mathcal G=(R,O,E,A,M,L,Q,V,\nu),
\]

including the reference population, observation operator, representation,
regularization, metric, tie-safe landmark orbit, refusal rule, profile map,
and uncertainty contract. It also freezes the corrected W2, W3, W4, W4b,
W7, and G1 aggregate decisions; their source-artifact hashes; the V7 code,
configs, schemas, protocols, tests, and the evidence-status lattice.

The highest supported release claim is:

`OPERATOR_INDEXED_RELATIVE_TEXT_GEOMETRY_WITHIN_DECLARED_DOMAIN`

The tracked release evidence contains aggregate rows only. Raw text, raw
identifiers, per-person scores, and restricted corpora are not included.

## What is not established

This release does not establish named personality factors, reliability or a
G coefficient, minimum detectable difference, state-trait decomposition,
clinical validity, cultural or language invariance, complete OOD detection,
universal factor count, market prediction, or transport of source norms,
landmarks, coordinates, and labels into another domain.

Unknown empirical relations are frozen as `UNTESTED/NO CLAIM`, not as null
findings. PANDORA and the MEPS feasibility corpus were development or
fixed-condition feasibility inputs; neither is a new V7 personality-validity
confirmation set.

## Independent future gates

1. **Repeated measurement**: crossed person/condition/occasion data must
   estimate reliability, state-trait variance, scoring uncertainty, and MDD.
2. **External construct validity**: cohorts, anchors, reliability correction,
   effect floors, artifacts, incremental validity, and replication must be
   frozen before labels are opened.
3. **Domain transport**: target-local reference fitting is mandatory unless a
   paired bridge identifies an alignment. Source coordinates cannot be reused.

Measurement-only use on a new corpus with target-local references does not
open an outcome lockbox. The first analysis against market outcomes, clinical
criteria, or unseen psychological labels is a new opening and requires a
separate preregistration.

## Verification

```bash
python scripts/verify_suica_v020_lockbox.py
sha256sum release/v0.2.0/LOCKBOX_MANIFEST.json
git rev-parse v0.2.0^{commit}
```

The annotated tag message records the manifest SHA-256. A verifier can compare
that value with the checked-out manifest and then verify every critical file.

## Relation to the v0.1 preregistration

The v0.1 P5 preregistration is a separate historical lockbox. Opening #1 was
spent on 2026-07-07: the overall rule failed (2/7; required at least 4/7), H2
and H6 individually passed, one legacy opening remains, and the Essays
confirm-half remains unopened. Version 0.2.0 does not rewrite that frozen
record or reset its budget.
